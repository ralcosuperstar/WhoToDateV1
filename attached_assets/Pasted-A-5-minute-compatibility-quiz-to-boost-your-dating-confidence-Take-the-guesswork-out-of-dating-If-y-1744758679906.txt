. WhoToDate is here to change that. We offer a light, engaging quiz that gives you a personalized dating compatibility report. It’s not a matchmaking app but a self-discovery tool rooted in psychology, tailored for Indian singles (teens and adults alike) who want clarity and confidence in their dating life. Why take our quiz? In just 40 questions, you’ll:
Know Yourself Better: Uncover your personality traits, attachment style, and values – key factors that shape how you love and who you connect with. Self-awareness is a superpower in dating.
Find Out Who Fits You: Learn what kind of partner would complement you best. Your report highlights areas of compatibility and potential friction, so you can focus on relationships that click. No more wasting time on the wrong matches!
Get Science-Backed Insights: We use proven psychological frameworks (Big Five, MBTI, Attachment Theory, Emotional Intelligence, Moral Foundations) for our analysis. These aren’t random buzzwords – these are the same factors researchers have linked to happy relationships (for example, being high in certain traits like agreeableness can lead to more satisfying relationships​

).
Enjoy Culturally Tuned Advice: Unlike one-size-fits-all personality tests, WhoToDate is built with Indian dating culture in mind. We get the importance of family dynamics, traditional values vs. modern views, and even the arranged marriage context. Your results and tips respect your cultural background and beliefs.
Have Fun, No Pressure: This quiz feels more like a playful chat than an exam. People often find the questions thought-provoking and even fun! It’s quick (about 5 minutes), and your results are instant and private. Plus, it’s completely free – and always will be for the basic report.
🔍 What’s the Unique Value?
WhoToDate isn’t a dating app – it’s better. We won’t show you random profiles or make you swipe endlessly (only for two-thirds of those matches to never meet in real life​
timesofindia.indiatimes.com
). Instead, we empower you with knowledge about yourself. Think of it as getting a roadmap for your love life. You wouldn’t drive to a new place without GPS; why date without a little guidance? Our guidance is:
Psychology-Backed: Grounded in research from psychology. We’re talking the same personality factors therapists and counselors discuss with couples. This means the advice you get isn’t superstition or gimmick – it’s based on traits and patterns shown to matter in relationships.
Non-Judgmental & Private: It’s not a test you pass or fail. There are no “bad” personalities here. Your answers and results are confidential (we don’t post anything to social media or share it). It’s a safe space to be honest.
Growth-Focused: Whether you get a “green” or “red” result (more on that below), the goal is to help you grow. The report gives tips on how to improve yourself or what to watch out for. We want you to not just find a compatible partner, but also become the best version of you in a relationship.
🎯 How Does It Work?
Take the Quiz: Answer 40 simple questions about yourself – like your habits, feelings, and preferences. (Example: “Your date is 30 minutes late, you… a) stay totally calm, b) start worrying or c) get irritated but wait.”) There are no right or wrong answers, just be honest. The quiz is designed to be casual and insightful, not burdensome.
Get Your Results: Immediately after, you’ll see your Compatibility Report, including a color-coded badge and a detailed breakdown (we’ll explain the colors in a second!). You’ll learn about your personality type, attachment style, emotional intelligence, core values, and more – plus what it all means for your love life. (Think of it like a personalized dating guidebook about you.)
Use Your Insights: With your new self-knowledge, you can approach dating or relationships with fresh confidence. You’ll know what you need, what to look for, and even get tips on how to communicate better. If you want extra help, we even list optional counselors you can talk to (totally up to you – some people like an expert opinion). And guess what? Many users share their results with potential partners to spark deeper conversations. It’s a great way to move beyond small talk and really see if you’re on the same wavelength!
(We’ll dive into more “How it Works” details on a separate page, including step-by-step and an example report. But first, let’s highlight something cool you’ll see in your results.)
🟢🟡🔴 Your Compatibility Badge
Every WhoToDate report comes with a color-coded compatibility badge – kind of like a traffic light for your love life! This badge gives you a quick overall read on your dating compatibility outlook. Here’s what the colors mean:
🟢 Green: High Compatibility. This is the “all systems go!” signal. A green badge means your traits and attitudes are well-aligned for relationship success. You likely have a good handle on communication, know what you want, and have traits that generally make relationships easier. (For example, you might have a secure attachment style and high emotional intelligence – great combo!). Green doesn’t mean “perfect person” – it means you’re in a great spot to find and sustain a healthy relationship.
🟡 Yellow: Moderate Compatibility. A yellow badge means “proceed with a little caution.” There are some areas where you might hit bumps in a relationship. Maybe you’re very introverted while many of your potential partners might be extroverted, or perhaps you have an anxious attachment that could cause worry in dating. It’s not a stop sign at all – it just means being aware. Your report will highlight these specific areas and give advice on how to navigate them. Think of yellow as a balanced profile: mostly smooth sailing, with a few storms you can learn to weather.
🔴 Red: Potential Challenges. A red badge is a heads-up that you and relationships might mix a bit like oil and water without some work. Typically, this comes from having several strong mismatches or risk factors – like very conflicting values, very low emotional intelligence (e.g., trouble handling emotions), or an avoidant attachment combined with high neuroticism (worry). DON’T panic if you get red! It doesn’t mean you’re doomed in love. It means you’ve got some specific areas to pay attention to. The report will tell you exactly what they are and how to improve or what kind of partner could balance you out. Many people with “red” profiles find that just being aware of their challenges helps them make positive changes. And remember, even a red light eventually turns green with the right approach!
Real Users, Real Stories:
“I was skeptical at first, but the WhoToDate quiz blew me away. My report explained why my last relationship fell apart (turns out my anxious attachment and my ex’s avoidant attachment were a recipe for chaos!). It also showed me I got a Yellow badge – fair, because I do have some things to work on. The best part? It gave me tips on how to communicate my needs. I feel so much more confident about dating now.” – Aditi, 24
“I’m a 19-year-old college student and totally new to dating. I took the quiz on a whim. It was actually fun, and the results were eerily accurate. I’m an INFP and have a Secure attachment (didn’t even know what that meant before!). The report called me a ‘Thoughtful Idealist.’ It pointed out that while I’m good at empathy and listening (yay), I sometimes avoid conflict too much. That is so me. Now I know what to watch out for, and I have a green badge which feels encouraging. My friends are all taking the quiz now too!” – Sneha, 19
“The cultural bits in the report were a nice surprise. I’m 28, and my parents are already talking marriage. My WhoToDate results gave me language to explain to them what I’m looking for in a partner (beyond just “good family, good job” criteria). I got a Yellow, meaning some things to consider. One highlight was that I value Openness and independence a lot, which might clash with very traditional expectations – so it advised how to communicate that to a future partner and even my family. This is like a modern alternative to the old horoscope matching, but actually based on my personality. Love it!” – Rahul, 28
