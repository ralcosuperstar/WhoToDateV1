🧠 Talk to Someone Who Gets It
Because healing begins when you feel heard.
Modern relationships can be confusing, overwhelming, and sometimes even painful. Whether you’re stuck in overthinking, fresh out of a breakup, scared about commitment, or feeling physically drained from emotional stress — you don’t have to go through it alone.

At WhoToDate, we’ve teamed up with a diverse group of verified mental wellness professionals and medical graduate listeners to support your emotional journey. No judgment, no pressure — just real people trained to help, right when you need it.

👥 Two Types of Counselling Support — Pick What’s Right for You
We know everyone’s needs are different. That’s why we offer two flexible options for emotional support:

🧑‍🎓 Psychology-Based Counselors
(M.A./B.A. in Psychology – Emotional Listeners & Mental Health Guides)
Session Duration: 45 to 90 minutes
Cost Range: ₹700 – ₹2000

Best for:
Emotional overwhelm, anxious thoughts, or overthinking

Talking through breakups, loneliness, dating doubts, or life crossroads

Exploring patterns in your behavior or past relationships

Deep listening and gentle guidance to untangle emotional knots

What to Expect:
These counselors hold formal Psychology degrees (M.A. or B.A.) and are trained to help you process your emotions.

They won’t diagnose or prescribe, but they’ll help you reflect, understand yourself better, and find clarity.

Sessions feel like a safe, structured conversation — with someone who knows how to truly listen.

Common Topics:
“Why do I always fall for the wrong person?”

“My parents are pressuring me to get married — I feel stuck.”

“I can’t move on from my ex. It’s affecting everything.”

“I’m scared I’ll end up alone, and I hate feeling this way.”

🩺 Medical Graduate Listeners (MBBS, BAMS, BHMS, BDS)
(First Responders to Emotional & Psychosomatic Stress)
Call Duration: 15 to 20 minutes
Cost Range: ₹300 – ₹500

Best for:
Physical symptoms triggered by emotional pain (like chest tightness, breathlessness, vomiting, nausea, etc.)

Sudden anxiety, emotional shock, trauma-like symptoms

Needing quick support, especially when the body starts reacting to stress

What to Expect:
These are certified doctors from MBBS/BAMS/BHMS/BDS backgrounds trained to listen with kindness and care, not rush.

They don’t provide therapy or prescriptions, but they’re here to calm you, understand your symptoms, and suggest a safe path forward.

Think of them as your first responders for emotional emergencies — compassionate, medically trained, and here to guide you toward healing.

Example Situations:
“I feel like I can’t breathe after my breakup.”

“My heart hurts whenever I remember what happened — is that normal?”

“I threw up after a fight with my partner. I’m scared.”

🙋‍♀️ How Do I Choose Which Support I Need?
Here’s a simple way to decide what’s right for you:


Situation	Recommended Support
You’re feeling emotionally drained, stuck in overthinking, or confused about a relationship	✅ Psychology-Based Counselor
You’re dealing with grief, heartbreak, self-doubt, or anxiety from dating/marriage pressure	✅ Psychology-Based Counselor
You want someone to deeply listen and guide you for 45+ minutes	✅ Psychology-Based Counselor
You’re feeling chest pain, vomiting, breathlessness, dizziness, or physical discomfort after an emotional event	✅ Medical Graduate Listener (First Responder)
You’re unsure what’s happening, but your body feels “off” after emotional trauma	✅ Medical Graduate Listener
You need to speak with someone quickly to calm your nerves	✅ Medical Graduate Listener
💬 Why Does Talking Help?
When your heart is heavy, your thoughts spiral, or your body reacts to pain — keeping it all inside only makes it worse. Research shows that just talking to a trained listener can lower stress hormones, stabilize breathing, and reduce feelings of isolation.

Whether you're:

Crying over someone who ghosted you

Nervous before saying “yes” to marriage

Struggling to understand why love feels so hard

Or just need someone to listen…

Counselling gives you space.
A space to feel heard.
A space to slow down.
A space to say, “I don’t know what’s wrong, but I need to talk.”

You deserve that.
