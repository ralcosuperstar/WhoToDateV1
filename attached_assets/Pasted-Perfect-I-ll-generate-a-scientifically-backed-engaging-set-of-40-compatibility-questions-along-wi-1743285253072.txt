Dating Self Profile Questionnaire & Compatibility Report – Specification
Introduction & Purpose
This document outlines a comprehensive 40-question personality and compatibility questionnaire for a dating self-profile MVP (Minimum Viable Product). The goal is to help users introspect about their personality, values, and relationship expectations, and to generate a personalized compatibility report. The questionnaire is grounded in established psychological frameworks (Big Five traits, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Attachment Theory, Emotional Intelligence, Moral Foundations Theory) and is tailored with Indian cultural sensitivity in mind. Questions are written in an engaging tone – a balance of witty, relatable scenarios and thoughtful, emotionally introspective prompts – to keep users interested while prompting honest self-reflection. Cultural nuances around topics like physical intimacy, virginity beliefs, and sex-before-marriage are subtly integrated, recognizing their importance in the Indian context (63% want to marry virgins, but majority approve of premarital sex | Latest News India - Hindustan Times).
Upon completion, the user will receive a rich compatibility report including:
•	An overall compatibility color code (Green, Yellow, or Red) indicating how easily they may find a compatible partner (Green = smooth compatibility, Yellow = some caution areas, Red = significant challenges).
•	Section-wise scores for key dimensions – Personality, Emotional Intelligence (EQ), Values, and Physical/Moral Beliefs – each with an explanation.
•	Personalized dating guidance: an analysis of what kind of partner they’d likely gel with or conflict with, potential deal-breakers, and suggestions for compromises or personal growth.
•	An encouraging, motivational tone throughout the report that acknowledges the user’s strengths, gently addresses any red flags, and encourages personal growth (e.g. tips to improve communication or reconcile conflicting values).
•	Visual elements: a radar chart and/or color-coded bar graphs illustrating the user’s trait profile (for example, a Big Five traits radar, or bars for each compatibility dimension), as well as a shareable badge/image summarizing their compatibility result for virality.
•	Options to download the full report as a PDF and easily share highlights on social media.
This specification provides all questionnaire text and the logic required to implement it on Replit (as a web-based experience), ensuring the entire user journey is fully automated – from answering questions, to payment gating, to report generation and sharing.
Psychological Frameworks & Rationale
To ensure depth and accuracy, each question is informed by one or more psychological theories or frameworks:
•	Big Five Personality Traits (OCEAN) – Research shows that personality traits strongly shape relationship dynamics (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today) (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today). For instance, high Extraversion can improve communication and social intimacy (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today), high Agreeableness and Conscientiousness are linked to relationship satisfaction (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today) (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today), while high Neuroticism often predicts conflict and lower satisfaction (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today). Our questions measure these traits in relatable ways, as well as facets of the popular MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) for user familiarity. (Note: While MBTI is not a scientifically validated compatibility tool (Personality Type Compatibility: What the Myers-Briggs Test Says), its dimensions like Introversion/Extraversion or Thinking/Feeling can still offer personal insight.)
•	Attachment Theory – Attachment styles (Secure, Anxious, Avoidant, Disorganized) describe how people form bonds and handle intimacy. These styles greatly impact dating behavior: for example, an anxiously attached person may experience jealousy and fear of abandonment (Attachment Style Quiz: What's Your Relationship Attachment Style?), whereas an avoidant person may value independence and have difficulty trusting others (Attachment Style Quiz: What's Your Relationship Attachment Style?). A few questions simulate scenarios (e.g. a partner not replying for hours) to reveal the user’s likely attachment style, since compatibility is higher when attachment needs are understood (a secure-secure pairing tends to be smooth, anxious-avoidant pairings often struggle, etc.).
•	Emotional Intelligence (EQ) – The ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions is critical for healthy relationships. High EQ correlates with happier, more resilient partnerships (Emotional Intelligence in Relationships | True You Journal) (Emotional Intelligence in Relationships | True You Journal). Questions in this area assess how the user handles conflict, communicates feelings, empathizes with a partner’s needs, and copes with stress – all vital for relationship success. (For example, being able to calmly discuss problems and listen is a sign of high EQ and predicts long-term relationship success (Emotional Intelligence in Relationships | True You Journal).)
•	Moral Foundations & Values – Drawing on Moral Foundations Theory, people prioritize values differently (e.g. some emphasize care and fairness, others value loyalty, authority, sanctity more (Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) shows that liberals prioritize values ...)). Value alignment is crucial: studies show that successful couples often share core beliefs and habits up to 89% similarity on average (Opposites may not actually attract when it comes to love as old theory debunked | Nestia). We include questions on cultural/religious values, family expectations, gender roles, and personal integrity to gauge how traditional or progressive the user is. This helps identify potential compatibility or friction with partners (for instance, one question asks about the importance of shared religion/caste, as 44% of people say shared religious beliefs are important for marriage (The Importance of Shared Interests in Relationships | Psychology Today), especially in India where 74% of young adults still prefer arranged marriage (Why Are So Many Indian Arranged Marriages Successful? | Psychology Today) and marrying within one’s community is common).
•	Physical and Moral Beliefs around Intimacy – Attitudes toward physical intimacy and sexual morals can make or break compatibility, particularly in the Indian context where these topics are often sensitive. Our questions delicately probe the user’s views on sex before marriage, virginity, PDA (public displays of affection), and related expectations. This is backed by the understanding that mismatched expectations here can cause major conflicts. (For example, if one partner believes in waiting until marriage while the other is more liberal, it’s critical to identify that upfront.) Surveys show modern Indian youth hold nuanced views – 61% say premarital sex isn’t a taboo, yet 63% still prefer to marry a virgin (63% want to marry virgins, but majority approve of premarital sex | Latest News India - Hindustan Times) – indicating the complexity of blending tradition and modernity. By asking these questions, we help users clarify what they truly want, and we can guide them to seek partners with compatible beliefs. Moreover, research globally confirms that sexual compatibility and open communication about intimacy are important for relationship satisfaction ( What Matters in a Relationship—Age, Sexual Satisfaction, Relationship Length, and Interpersonal Closeness as Predictors of Relationship Satisfaction in Young Adults - PMC ).
Overall, the questionnaire is designed to highlight the user’s personality profile, emotional style, core values, and intimacy beliefs, then use those insights to provide actionable dating guidance. In essence, it functions as a mirror – reflecting who the user is and what they need in a partner – and a map, suggesting paths to a fulfilling relationship or areas to grow.
Questionnaire Structure & Content
The 40 questions are organized into four sections of 10 questions each, aligning with the categories above: Personality, Emotional Intelligence & Attachment, Values & Beliefs, and Physical/Moral Intimacy Beliefs. Each question is numbered and offers multiple-choice answers (a–d). The answer choices are written to be descriptive and relatable, often phrased as scenarios or statements the user can identify with. They range across a spectrum of possible attitudes or behaviors, enabling nuanced scoring. Users should select the option that best reflects their typical feeling or reaction. There are no “right” or “wrong” answers – the aim is to capture authentic personal tendencies.
Below is the complete list of 40 questions with answer options:
Section 1: Personality Traits (10 Questions)
This section gauges the user’s Big Five traits and related personality preferences. It mixes in elements of MBTI dichotomies (e.g. introversion vs extroversion, planning vs spontaneity) in a fun way. Each question’s options range from one personality extreme to the other.
1. It’s Friday night. What sounds most appealing to you?
•	a. Hitting a big party or meet-up – you’ll likely be found chatting with everyone and energizing the room.
•	b. A small get-together with close friends – good conversations with your favorite people.
•	c. A cozy night in – Netflix, a book, or gaming, enjoying some solo downtime or one-on-one with a partner.
•	d. Going to bed early – crowds and social scenes aren’t your thing, you’d rather recharge alone.
(This question gauges Introversion vs. Extraversion in a relatable scenario.)
2. When it comes to keeping your space (room/desk) organized:
•	a. “Everything has its place” – You’re meticulously neat, and clutter seriously bugs you.
•	b. You prefer things fairly tidy, though a little mess is okay as long as it’s not out of control.
•	c. “Organized chaos” – Your space is messy but functional, and you can usually find what you need.
•	d. Utterly chaotic – piles of stuff everywhere, cleaning isn’t a priority until it’s absolutely necessary.
(Reveals Conscientiousness level: how disciplined and organized vs. easy-going or careless the person is.)
3. You’ve planned a weekend trip with your partner. How do you approach it?
•	a. You create a detailed itinerary days in advance, complete with hotel bookings, routes, and a list of sights to see. Preparation is key!
•	b. You list a couple of must-do activities but leave plenty of free time for spontaneous adventures. Balance is good.
•	c. You decide to just wing it – no fixed plans, just go with the flow when you arrive. Spontaneity makes it fun.
•	d. Trip? Oh, you didn’t get around to planning anything… You’ll figure it out (or not) once you’re there.
(Also examines Conscientiousness vs. Spontaneity. Option a = highly structured (akin to MBTI “Judging” type), d = very spontaneous/procrastinating (MBTI “Perceiving”).)
4. If someone (friend or partner) criticizes you or points out a mistake you made, you usually:
•	a. Appreciate the feedback and calmly discuss how to improve – you own up to it and consider it constructively.
•	b. Feel a bit defensive initially, but later reflect and maybe apologize if needed – you try to be fair.
•	c. Get upset or anxious and might take it quite personally – it really bothers you to be criticized.
•	d. Brush it off or counter-criticize them – you don’t like being blamed and might feel they’re overreacting.
(Taps into Agreeableness and Neuroticism: how one handles criticism – with humility vs. defensiveness, emotional stability vs. anxiety.)
5. Your ideal approach to solving a problem or making a big decision is:
•	a. Analyze it with cold hard logic – pros/cons lists, maybe spreadsheets. Emotions shouldn’t cloud judgment.
•	b. Consider the facts but also listen to your gut feelings and values – a mix of head and heart.
•	c. Go with what feels right in your heart – if it aligns with your emotions and values, that’s the choice.
•	d. Honestly, you often defer the decision hoping it resolves itself, or ask someone you trust to decide for you.
(Relates to Thinking vs. Feeling (logical vs. empathetic decision-making) and decisiveness. Option a is a Thinking style, c a Feeling style, b balanced, d indicates indecisiveness/avoidance.)
6. How do you usually handle meeting new people at a gathering or event?
•	a. You love it – you naturally introduce yourself, ask questions, and enjoy the whole process of making new friends.
•	b. You don’t mind it – you’ll chat if approached and can be friendly, though you may not seek out everyone.
•	c. It’s a bit uncomfortable – you stick mostly with people you know and might meet one or two new folks if they initiate.
•	d. You actively avoid it – you find a corner or stay on your phone to dodge small talk as much as possible.
(Another angle on Introversion/Extraversion and social comfort.)
7. When working on a project (or in your job), what style describes you best?
•	a. Highly organized and planful – you set milestones, meet deadlines early, and feel stressed if things aren’t structured.
•	b. Fairly reliable – you plan a bit and generally meet deadlines, with an occasional last-minute cram if needed.
•	c. More improvisational – you work in bursts of energy and might pull it off at the last minute, but it works for you.
•	d. Quite slack or disorganized – deadlines and plans often sneak up on you, and you struggle to stick to a schedule.
(Assesses Conscientiousness in work habits, complementary to Q2 and Q3. Good for understanding dependability.)
8. Imagine your partner or close friend is going through a tough challenge (job loss, exam failure). You are more likely to:
•	a. Offer practical advice and help them problem-solve logically – you believe in tackling the issue head-on more than hand-holding.
•	b. Give a listening ear and emotional support first, and gently suggest solutions later – a mix of empathy and problem-solving.
•	c. Immediately try to comfort them – lots of hugs, understanding, and reassurance, focusing on their feelings rather than the fix.
•	d. Feel a bit lost on how to help – you might awkwardly try to distract them or just hope they handle it, since deep emotional talk isn’t your forte.
(Reflects Thinking vs. Feeling in interpersonal support: analytical support vs. emotional empathy. Also links to Emotional Intelligence, but primarily personality inclination.)
**9. Your friends would say you :
(Complete the sentence with the option that fits best)
•	a. Are creative and adventurous – always keen to try new experiences, foods, ideas, and share them.
•	b. Are practical and down-to-earth – you prefer familiar things and reliable routines, not wild experiments.
•	c. Are warm and friendly – you get along with most people and avoid unnecessary conflicts.
•	d. Are straightforward and blunt – you speak your mind even if it ruffles some feathers occasionally.
(This is a mixed trait question: Options a/b target Openness to Experience (high vs low), options c/d target Agreeableness (high vs low). The user might resonate with more than one, but should pick the most salient description.)
10. In group work or when planning with others, your style is:
•	a. Take charge – you naturally step into a leadership role, voicing ideas and organizing the team.
•	b. Collaborative – you prefer to share input and listen to everyone, aiming for consensus and harmony.
•	c. Whatever works – you’ll follow the group’s lead and do your part, but you don’t particularly want to lead or debate.
•	d. Independent – you’d rather just do things on your own if possible; dealing with differing opinions is frustrating.
(Measures aspects of Assertiveness/Leadership (a) vs. Agreeableness/Cooperativeness (b, c) vs. independence/low teamwork (d). It indicates how one might function in a relationship when making joint decisions – collaborative vs controlling vs avoidant.)
Section 2: Emotional Intelligence & Relationship Style (10 Questions)
This section explores how the user deals with emotions – both their own and their partner’s – and their attachment-related behaviors in relationships. The tone ranges from light-hearted scenarios to introspective feelings questions.
11. When you and your partner have a serious disagreement or fight, what do you usually do afterwards?
•	a. Initiate a talk as soon as possible to resolve it – you hate letting conflicts linger and prefer to address the issue calmly.
•	b. Cool off for a while and then discuss it later – you need a bit of space to process, but you won’t sweep it under the rug.
•	c. Give the silent treatment for a day or more – you find it hard to immediately engage, and you wait for them to approach or for things to blow over.
•	d. Get very upset and worry the relationship is in jeopardy – you might cry, panic, or feel sick until reassured that things are okay.
(Looks at conflict resolution and attachment: a = high EQ, proactive; b = moderate EQ; c = avoidant conflict style; d = anxious style, fear of abandonment.)
12. Your partner hasn’t replied to your messages all day. How do you feel?
•	a. Concerned but composed – you figure they’re busy or something came up, and you’ll patiently wait or gently check in by evening.
•	b. A bit annoyed or hurt – you don’t like being ignored, but you’ll likely send a follow-up text and try not to overthink it.
•	c. Very anxious – you start imagining something’s wrong: “Did I do something? Are they upset or in trouble?” It gnaws at you.
•	d. Largely unfazed – it’s fine, you have your own day going on. You’ll talk when you talk; you value that kind of independence.
(Diagnoses attachment reactions: a = secure, b = slight anxious or simply communicative, c = anxious attachment, d = avoidant attachment. Also tests trust vs. insecurity.)
13. If your partner or close friend is visibly upset but says “I’m fine” when you ask, you will:
•	a. Gently press them: “I can tell something’s off. You know I’m here for you – want to talk about it?” (You ensure they feel supported and not alone.)
•	b. Give them some space but keep an eye on them – maybe later you’ll do something nice or try again to see if they want to share.
•	c. Take it at face value and drop the topic – you don’t want to pry; if they say they’re fine, you’ll let it be unless they bring it up.
•	d. Feel frustrated and shut down too – if they won’t open up, you withdraw as well, though inside you might worry or stew about it.
(Assesses empathy and communication: a = high empathy and willingness to help, b = moderate/considerate, c = low engagement (could be respectful or could be low awareness), d = low EQ response/potentially avoidant.)
14. How easily do you say “sorry” or admit fault in a relationship?
•	a. Very easily – if I realize I’m wrong or hurt them, I’ll apologize sincerely and quickly. Owning up is important.
•	b. I will apologize, but I might explain my perspective too – I want to be understood that it wasn’t malicious.
•	c. It’s hard for me to admit I’m wrong – I might do it reluctantly or avoid situations where I’d have to apologize.
•	d. I often end up saying sorry even when it’s not my fault, just to keep the peace or make them feel better.
(Reveals communication and conflict style: a = high EQ, accountable; b = moderate with slight defensiveness; c = low agreeableness/prideful; d = people-pleasing (could be anxious or low self-esteem).)
15. When your partner achieves something great (promotion, personal goal), how do you react?
•	a. Celebrate enthusiastically – you feel genuinely proud and let them know, maybe plan a special dinner or gift. Their win is your win.
•	b. You’re happy for them and say “congrats!”, of course – you knew they could do it. (You feel proud, though you keep the celebration modest.)
•	c. You feel happy but also a twinge of insecurity or jealousy – it reminds you of your own shortcomings, even if you don’t show it.
•	d. You acknowledge it but don’t make a big deal – a simple “nice job” and move on. You’re not one for over-the-top reactions or you feel awkward celebrating.
(Measures capacity for emotional support vs. personal insecurity: a/b show supportive partnership (high EQ), c reveals insecurity/envy, d could indicate low emotional expressiveness or mild envy.)
16. How do you handle jealousy in a relationship?
•	a. You rarely get jealous – you have strong trust. If issues arise, you openly talk them through rather than snooping or accusing.
•	b. You feel a bit jealous occasionally (who doesn’t?), but you try not to let it show. You might seek subtle reassurance from your partner.
•	c. You do get jealous easily – for example, you’d feel upset if your partner is too friendly with someone else, and you might confront them or feel insecure.
•	d. You tend to dismiss jealousy entirely – if a partner is jealous, that’s their issue. You value freedom and wouldn’t tolerate being checked on either.
(Targets trust vs jealousy: a = secure trust (high EQ), b = mild normal jealousy, c = high jealousy (anxious attachment tendency), d = very independent/possibly avoidant stance.)
17. When it comes to talking about your feelings with a partner:
•	a. You’re an open book – you can freely share your feelings, needs, and even vulnerabilities. Communication is key for you.
•	b. You communicate important feelings when necessary, but it might take you a little time to get there. You’re not 100% open all the time.
•	c. It’s hard for you – you prefer to show you care through actions, or you just keep a lot inside to avoid drama or seeming “weak.”
•	d. Your emotions often overwhelm you – you can end up oversharing or having emotional outbursts that you later regret.
(Assesses emotional openness and regulation: a = high openness (secure), b = moderately open, c = reserved/avoidant, d = low emotional regulation (high neuroticism) or anxious drama.)
18. If your partner does something that hurts your feelings a little (not a huge deal, but it bothers you), what’s your likely response?
•	a. You tell them calmly what bothered you, because they can’t read your mind. You aim for a constructive discussion and then let it go.
•	b. You might drop hints or act a bit off until they notice something’s wrong, but eventually you’ll mention it if they ask.
•	c. You stay quiet about it – it’s not worth an argument. You’d rather avoid conflict and just let it slide, even if it adds to your resentments.
•	d. You react with sarcasm or a snappy comment in the moment, or sulk noticeably – they should know you’re upset without you spelling it out.
(Reveals communication and conflict style: a = direct, healthy communication (high EQ, assertive); b = indirect but not too toxic; c = conflict-avoidant (could lead to bottled feelings); d = passive-aggressive or poor communication style.)
19. Think about stressful situations (work pressure, family issues) – how do they affect your relationship or mood with your partner?
•	a. You handle stress gracefully – you might share what’s going on but you don’t take it out on your partner. You still treat them with love even when stressed.
•	b. You can get a bit tense or distracted, but you try not to snap. If you do, you apologize. Your partner knows it’s the stress talking sometimes.
•	c. When you’re stressed, it often spills over – you become more irritable or distant, and your partner might feel like they’re walking on eggshells.
•	d. You tend to withdraw completely under stress – you shut down and maybe ignore your partner unintentionally, dealing with it alone.
(Assesses emotional regulation and how external stress impacts the relationship: a/b = higher emotional management, c = lower (neuroticism), d = avoidant coping.)
20. What best describes your attachment style or feelings in close relationships?
(If unsure, pick the statement you resonate with most.)
•	a. Secure: You find it relatively easy to trust others and be close. You’re comfortable depending on your partner and them depending on you, and you communicate needs openly.
•	b. Anxious: You love being very close, but you worry others don’t want to be as close to you. You need frequent reassurance and can get jealous or very upset by small things.
•	c. Avoidant: You’re independent and often feel uncomfortable with too much closeness. You value personal space a lot, and may find partners often want more intimacy than you’re comfortable with.
•	d. Not Sure/Mixed: You can swing between needing affection and pushing people away. You’re not quite one or the other consistently (perhaps a bit disorganized in attachment).
(This directly asks the user to self-identify their attachment tendencies. It serves as a self-reflection and a cross-check against earlier scenario responses.)
Section 3: Values & Beliefs (10 Questions)
This section delves into the user’s core values, morals, and cultural beliefs – especially those relevant in an Indian dating context. The questions cover family dynamics, life priorities, honesty, and tradition vs modernity. They are phrased in a respectful yet engaging way, sometimes using scenarios familiar in Indian culture.
21. Whose opinion matters most when you’re choosing someone to date or marry?
•	a. Mine, ultimately. I will consider my family’s input, but the final decision is mine because I have to live with it.
•	b. It’s a balance – I give weight to my parents’/family’s approval, but also to my own feelings. Ideally both align.
•	c. My family’s opinion carries a lot of weight. If they strongly disapprove, it would be very hard for me to go against them.
•	d. Only mine – I would go ahead with my choice even if family or society disagrees. Love is personal.
(Addresses family influence vs individual choice. In India, many lean on family input; e.g. a majority still have arranged marriages (Why Are So Many Indian Arranged Marriages Successful? | Psychology Today). Option c = very family-dependent, a/d = individual-centric.)
22. How important is it that your future partner is from the same religion, community, or cultural background as you?
•	a. Extremely important. Shared religion/caste/culture is non-negotiable for me – it’s essential for compatibility and family acceptance.
•	b. Preferable – it would make things easier if we share culture, but if we connect deeply, I could accept a different background with family convincing.
•	c. Not very important – I’m open to different backgrounds as long as our values and connection match. Culture can be learned and respected both ways.
•	d. Completely irrelevant – love has nothing to do with caste or religion. I might even prefer someone different for a more interesting life.
(This gauges traditional vs cosmopolitan outlook. Option a = very traditional (wants same background), d = very open. 44% of people cite shared religious beliefs as important in marriage (The Importance of Shared Interests in Relationships | Psychology Today), so this is a key compatibility area.)
23. What are your thoughts on gender roles in marriage/relationships?
•	a. I believe in traditional roles – for example, in a marriage, perhaps the husband as primary earner and the wife managing home (or similar defined roles). It’s worked for generations.
•	b. I’m okay with some traditional roles, but with flexibility – partners can decide who does what based on convenience, not just gender.
•	c. I believe in equal partnership – no fixed gender roles. Chores, earning, caregiving should be shared according to mutual agreement and individual strengths, not gender.
•	d. Gender roles should be completely dismantled – I actively dislike any expectation based on gender; partners should define their own unique dynamic.
(Measures conservatism vs modern egalitarian views. a = strongly traditional, c/d = strongly egalitarian, b = moderate middle.)
24. If you were in an unhappy marriage (no abuse, but just deeply incompatible or miserable), would you consider divorce?
•	a. No – I don’t believe in divorce. Marriage is for life, and you should work it out or just endure; every marriage has ups and downs.
•	b. Only after exhausting all efforts (counseling, family mediation, etc.). It’d be a last resort if nothing improves after years, because marriage is a serious commitment.
•	c. Yes, if we’re truly unhappy and incompatible despite trying, it’s better to part ways amicably. Life is too short to stay stuck forever.
•	d. Absolutely, yes – I think if it’s not working out, divorce is a valid solution, and it shouldn’t be stigmatized. I’d rather be happy alone than miserable together.
(Reveals traditional vs progressive stance on the permanence of marriage. Option a = very traditional, sees marriage as duty; d = very modern/individualistic.)
25. How do you feel about lying or hiding information in a relationship?
•	a. It’s never okay – honesty is the foundation. Even hard truths should be communicated rather than telling lies.
•	b. Generally one should be honest, but a small white lie here or there to spare feelings or avoid unnecessary conflict is sometimes acceptable.
•	c. It’s fine to withhold certain things – everyone is entitled to privacy/secrets. Not everything needs to be shared if it doesn’t directly hurt the partner.
•	d. People lie all the time, it’s human. As long as I don’t get caught or it doesn’t hurt them directly, I don’t see the big deal in a lie.
(Assesses integrity and openness: a = very honest, b = mostly honest with tact, c = more secretive, d = very lax about honesty. Honesty values affect trust compatibility.)
26. If your parents strongly disapproved of the person you love for unfair reasons (say, just because of different caste/region), what would you do?
•	a. Probably break up – going against my parents is not something I can do, even if I disagree with their reasons.
•	b. Try hard to convince my parents and mediate – I’d stand by my partner as much as possible, but I also really need my family’s blessing. This would be very stressful.
•	c. Stand by my partner firmly – I would attempt to reason with my parents, but if they don’t relent, I’m prepared to marry my partner without their approval.
•	d. Definitely choose my partner – I might even elope or marry in court if it came to that. My parents would hopefully come around later.
(Tests loyalty to family vs personal values: a/b indicate prioritizing family/authority (loyalty foundation), c/d prioritize individual love/fairness over tradition. Ties into Moral Foundations of Authority vs Fairness/Loyalty.)
27. What are your life priorities in the next 5-10 years?
•	a. Career/education comes first. I want to focus on personal growth and success; marriage or serious relationships can wait until I achieve certain goals.
•	b. A balance – I want to advance in career or personal goals, and ideally find a life partner/start a family in parallel. Both matter to me.
•	c. Settling down is top priority. I’d like to get married and maybe have kids relatively soon; career and other things can fit around that.
•	d. I’m pretty flexible/open – I go with the flow. I don’t have a strict timeline; if the right person or opportunity comes, I’ll adjust accordingly.
(Assesses ambition vs family orientation: a = career-first (which could mean they need a partner who understands that), c = family-first, b and d are moderate. Compatibility issues can arise if one person is in “now or never” mindset and the other isn’t.)
28. How would you describe your overall religious or spiritual outlook?
•	a. Devout/Traditional – Religion and traditional practices are very important in my life. I observe rituals, and I’d want a partner who does too or at least respects it deeply.
•	b. Moderately religious – I have faith and follow some traditions, but I’m also modern in many ways. I’d like my partner to respect my beliefs, though they don’t have to match perfectly.
•	c. Spiritual but not religious – I believe in certain values or spirituality on my own terms, but I’m not big on organized religion or strict traditions.
•	d. Not religious at all – I’m pretty secular/agnostic/atheist. Religion doesn’t play a role in my day-to-day life or values.
(This helps gauge the role of religion/tradition in their life. Mismatches here (e.g. very devout vs atheist) could be deal-breakers. Aligns with Moral Foundation of sanctity/tradition.)
29. Is cheating (infidelity) in a relationship ever forgivable in your eyes?
•	a. No, never. Cheating is a complete deal-breaker. If my partner cheats once, the relationship is over, no matter what.
•	b. It’s almost unforgivable – I would be devastated and it would likely end things, but maybe I’d consider giving one very final chance if it was a one-time mistake and they are extremely remorseful.
•	c. I don’t think it’s black and white – people make mistakes. I might try to work through it if the relationship has a strong foundation and they show genuine change, but it would be very hard.
•	d. It would hurt, but I might be able to forgive and move on eventually, especially if we have built a life/family. Everyone deserves a second chance, but not a third.
(Reveals values on loyalty and forgiveness. a = very strict moral stance (purity/loyalty emphasis), d = very forgiving/long-suffering. This affects what kind of partner behavior they can tolerate or not.)
30. “Honesty, Respect, Trust” – how would you rank these in importance for a relationship?
(Pick the option that best matches your priority.)
•	a. Trust > Respect > Honesty: If I trust someone fully, it covers a lot. Respect is second (we must value each other), and absolute honesty is third – sometimes tact matters more than brutal honesty.
•	b. Honesty > Trust > Respect: Complete honesty is the basis upon which trust is built, and mutual respect comes naturally if the first two are there.
•	c. Respect > Trust > Honesty: If two people deeply respect each other, they will behave in ways that maintain trust; honesty is important but not as crucial as understanding and respect.
•	d. Honestly, all three are equally vital – I can’t really rank them. Without any one of those, I feel a relationship would collapse.
(This is a more introspective, values clarification question. It forces the user to prioritize core relational values, though option d allows “all important”. The choice indicates what they might emphasize or compromise on: e.g., those who choose option a might be okay with white lies (honesty a bit lower) as long as trust is intact; those who choose b value truth very highly, etc.)
Section 4: Physical Intimacy & Moral Beliefs (10 Questions)
The final section focuses on attitudes toward physical intimacy, sex, and related moral beliefs. Questions are phrased sensitively, using euphemisms or gentle framing when needed, to account for cultural sensitivity. They aim to uncover the user’s comfort level with physical affection, expectations about premarital sex vs. waiting, and how they view sexual compatibility. These are critical for matching with a partner with similar comfort levels.
31. What level of physical affection are you generally comfortable with in a relationship?
•	a. Very high – Physical touch is one of my main love languages. I’m quite affectionate (hugs, cuddles, kisses) and need that closeness regularly to feel loved.
•	b. Moderate – I enjoy physical affection, like hugging and occasional PDA, but I don’t need it all the time. Balance between affection and personal space is good.
•	c. Low – I’m okay with physical touch in private, but I’m not very touchy-feely. I value emotional intimacy more, and I can go long periods without needing physical affection.
•	d. Very low – I’m generally not comfortable with much physical contact, even in private. I prefer to express love in other ways, and constant touching or PDA makes me uneasy.
(Assesses libido/affection needs. Matching high-affection with high-affection partners and likewise low-low tends to be important. Option a = high physical need, d = very touch-averse.)
32. What’s your stance on public displays of affection (PDA), like holding hands or a quick kiss in public?
•	a. I’m all for it – if you love someone, why hide it? Holding hands, a casual kiss, or a hug in public are totally fine by me (within reason).
•	b. I’m okay with mild PDA – holding hands or a brief hug/kiss is fine, but I wouldn’t be overly affectionate in public beyond that.
•	c. I feel a bit uncomfortable with PDA – I’d rather save affection for private moments. In public, I’d keep it limited (maybe just hand-holding at most).
•	d. I avoid PDA entirely – due to personal comfort or cultural reasons. I wouldn’t display affection publicly; I prefer to keep those moments completely private.
(Helps gauge how openly affectionate they can be given cultural norms. This can matter if one partner expects hand-holding and the other refuses any public contact.)
33. What are your personal beliefs about sex before marriage?
•	a. I believe in waiting until marriage. I prefer a relationship to be platonic/very limited physically until the wedding; that’s an important value for me.
•	b. Ideally wait, but it’s not a strict rule – I would try to wait, but if we’re engaged or very sure about each other, I might be okay with it happening a bit before marriage.
•	c. I’m okay with sex in a committed relationship even if not married – if we both consent and love each other, it can strengthen our bond. Marriage is not a must for intimacy.
•	d. I have no issue with premarital sex at all – it’s a natural part of a relationship if both people feel ready. In fact, it’s good to know sexual compatibility before marriage.
(Directly addresses premarital sex views. Options range from very conservative (a) to very liberal (d). This is crucial for compatibility: a person who picks (a) should be matched with someone of similar belief to avoid serious conflict.)
34. How important is it to you that the person you marry is a virgin (has never had sex before)?
•	a. Very important. I would ideally only marry someone who has never had any sexual relationships before me, and I intend to be the same for them.
•	b. Somewhat important – I would prefer if they are a virgin (especially at marriage), but I might accept a minor past if it was in a serious relationship.
•	c. Not very important – It’s their past. As long as they are honest and safe, I don’t think it defines their worth or our relationship quality.
•	d. Completely irrelevant – I do not care at all about virginity status, and I don’t think anyone should. A person’s character and how they treat me now is what matters.
(This question brings out any double standards or strong beliefs about virginity. It’s culturally sensitive: many Indian men desire a virgin bride even if they are not virgins (63% want to marry virgins, but majority approve of premarital sex | Latest News India - Hindustan Times) (63% want to marry virgins, but majority approve of premarital sex | Latest News India - Hindustan Times). The answers capture that range. This will influence guidance on who they should date – e.g. if they choose (a), they should likely seek someone with similar values to avoid disappointment.)
35. Would you consider living together (cohabiting) with your partner before marriage?
•	a. Absolutely yes – I think living together before marriage is a great way to understand compatibility. I have no reservations about it.
•	b. Maybe, under certain conditions – e.g., if we are engaged or heading toward marriage, I’d consider a short-term live-in. Otherwise, might be tricky with family.
•	c. Probably not – I’m not very comfortable with the idea due to personal/family values, but I might consider it in a very special case (while keeping it discreet).
•	d. No – I would not live with someone before marriage. It’s against my values (or I know my family would never approve). We can wait to be married to move in together.
(Addresses modern vs traditional approach to live-in relationships, which is a big cultural dividing line in India. Helps advise whether they need a similarly open-minded partner or not.)
36. How openly can you talk about sex or intimate topics with a partner?
•	a. Very openly – I believe it’s important to discuss likes, dislikes, boundaries. I’m comfortable having mature conversations about sex and intimacy.
•	b. Somewhat openly – It’s a bit awkward but I can manage to discuss it when needed, especially as the relationship grows serious.
•	c. I feel shy or uncomfortable – I prefer to avoid explicit conversations about sex. I’d rather let things just happen naturally than talk in detail.
•	d. I largely avoid it – I find it too embarrassing or taboo to talk about. Even if I have concerns or preferences, I struggle to voice them and just hope my partner understands.
(Measures communication about intimacy. A person who can’t talk about it (c or d) paired with someone who expects open dialogue (a) could face issues. Encourages growth in communication if needed.)
37. How important is sexual chemistry in a long-term relationship for you?
•	a. Very important – A strong sexual connection is a must. Without it, I would feel like something major is lacking in the relationship.
•	b. Quite important – It’s one of the important factors. It doesn’t have to be perfect all the time, but generally a healthy sex life is needed for me to be fully happy.
•	c. Somewhat important – It’s nice to have, but I prioritize emotional and intellectual connection more. Physical chemistry can develop or be worked on if other things are great.
•	d. Not important – I could be happy with a companionate relationship where sex is infrequent or even absent, as long as we love and support each other.
(Evaluates libido/priority of sex: a/b = high priority, c = moderate, d = low priority or asexual-leaning. Matching levels is key for long-term satisfaction ( What Matters in a Relationship—Age, Sexual Satisfaction, Relationship Length, and Interpersonal Closeness as Predictors of Relationship Satisfaction in Young Adults - PMC ).)
38. Imagine you’re in a committed relationship. How would you approach birth control and protection?
•	a. We should discuss and use it proactively – I’m very forward about planning (whether using contraception or, if we mutually want, planning when to have kids). It’s a responsible part of intimacy.
•	b. I’d rely on my partner or conventional norms – for example, typically expect the use of protection unless trying to conceive, but I might not initiate the conversation early.
•	c. It’s a bit awkward to discuss, but I have clear personal boundaries (e.g., no sex without protection or only after marriage so not applicable until then). Eventually, we’d figure out a method.
•	d. I haven’t thought about it much or I feel it’ll sort itself out – I might avoid the topic; if we truly love each other, we’ll deal with whatever happens.
(Checks practical attitude towards physical aspects. Option a shows maturity and comfort, d shows avoidance – which could be risky or indicate lack of knowledge. This can highlight if they need a partner who is more aware/responsible if they themselves are not.)
39. If your partner wanted to wait until marriage to have sex, but you did not (or vice versa), how would you handle it?
•	a. Respect their wishes and wait – even if my view differs, I would not pressure them. Love is patient, and we’d focus on other ways to connect until marriage.
•	b. Try to find a compromise or at least deeply discuss it – perhaps see if there’s a timeline we both can be okay with, or understand each other’s reasons better.
•	c. It would be very tough for me – I don’t think I could comfortably stay if we’re fundamentally mismatched on this. I might eventually push to either change their mind or end the relationship.
•	d. I would attempt to persuade them to see my perspective – not forcefully, but I’d hope to change their stance over time. If not, I might secretly resent it.
(Assesses willingness to compromise on intimacy timing: a = very accommodating (likely the one who’s okay waiting), c = not willing to compromise (if user is the one who doesn’t want to wait), b and d intermediate. This helps identify a deal-breaker area – if they choose c or d, it means a partner with a different view on premarital sex is going to be problematic.)
40. Finally, which statement about love and sex resonates with you more?
•	a. “Physical intimacy belongs within love and commitment.” – For me, sex is deeply tied to love. I can’t separate the two; I would only be intimate with someone I truly love (and ideally am committed to long-term).
•	b. “Love is primary, but sex is a natural extension.” – Emotional connection comes first, but I see sex as a healthy, natural part of expressing love (at the right time, not necessarily after marriage but when serious).
•	c. “They can be separate.” – It’s possible to have physical intimacy for pleasure or connection even without deep love, as long as there’s mutual respect. Love doesn’t have to be in the picture for sex, though it’s nice when it is.
•	d. “I’m unsure.” – I’m still figuring out my beliefs about love, sex, and how they relate. It’s complex, and my feelings could depend on the situation or person.
(This wraps up their general philosophy on intimacy. a = very traditional/romantic view, c = more liberal view separating sex and love, b = middle path, d = indicates uncertainty. This will color the interpretation of their other answers as well.)
________________________________________
Note: The user should answer all questions honestly for the most accurate profile. The tone of questions is meant to be non-judgmental and sometimes light-hearted. Even potentially sensitive answers (like valuing virginity or disliking PDA) are accommodated by the options – this ensures users feel their views are respected, whatever they are.
Scoring Methodology
Overview: Each answer the user selects is mapped to a numerical score that feeds into one or more of the four main categories: Personality, Emotional Intelligence (EQ), Values, Physical/Moral Beliefs. The scoring is designed to quantify where the user falls on various spectrums, and to identify potential compatibility strengths or challenges. The goal is not to “grade” the user as good or bad, but to create a profile of traits. However, for purposes of the compatibility report, certain traits or responses are considered to generally facilitate compatibility (these will score higher in that category), whereas others may indicate potential friction or a need for a very specific match (these score lower). We derive the overall Color Code from these scores.
Scoring Scale: Each question has 4 options (a, b, c, d). We will assign points from 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest) per question, where a higher score means the trait or attitude is more “compatible” or flexible in a general sense. Typically:
•	For personality traits, “healthy” or balanced expressions (e.g. moderate extroversion, high conscientiousness, high agreeableness, low neuroticism) score higher. Extremes that could cause compatibility issues (e.g. very high neuroticism leading to conflict, or extremely low sociability making it hard to meet people) score lower.
•	For EQ/attachment, emotionally intelligent behaviors (open communication, trust, secure attachment) score high, while potentially problematic behaviors (stonewalling, extreme jealousy, anxious panic or avoidant withdrawal) score lower.
•	For values, open-mindedness or moderate stances tend to score higher (as such individuals can adapt to different partners), whereas very rigid stances score lower (since they would require a partner of precisely the same beliefs to work). Importantly, a low score isn’t a “bad person” judgment – it indicates that the user will need a partner who very closely shares that specific value to avoid conflict.
•	For physical/moral beliefs, similarly, flexibility and communicative comfort are scored higher, while very strict or very avoidant positions are scored lower due to the potential difficulty in finding a mutually satisfying arrangement (given that sexual compatibility is a major factor in relationship success ( What Matters in a Relationship—Age, Sexual Satisfaction, Relationship Length, and Interpersonal Closeness as Predictors of Relationship Satisfaction in Young Adults - PMC )).
Each question primarily contributes to one category score (sections were organized by category), though a few hybrid questions might affect two. For simplicity:
•	Questions 1–10 → Personality score (with sub-traits tracked internally for Big Five).
•	Questions 11–20 → Emotional Intelligence (EQ) score.
•	Questions 21–30 → Values score.
•	Questions 31–40 → Physical/Moral Beliefs score.
Per-Question Scoring Examples: (Detailed mapping for each question can be prepared in the implementation. Below are examples and rationale for a few questions in each section.)
•	Q1 (Friday night – Introvert/Extrovert): Option a (party extrovert) = 4, b = 3, c = 2, d (avoid people) = 1.
Rationale: Being extremely introverted (d) might limit social activities with a partner or meeting new people, which can be a compatibility hurdle if the partner is social, hence lower score in general. High extroversion (a) is socially positive, though note we will later balance this with partner preference. (We also capture that the user is extroverted for the trait profile, not just the number.)
•	Q4 (Handling criticism – emotional reaction): a = 4 (high EQ, receptive), b = 3 (somewhat balanced), c = 2 (anxious/neurotic reaction), d = 1 (defensive/aggressive).
Rationale: This feeds both Personality (Neuroticism/Agreeableness) and EQ. Option a shows emotional stability and agreeableness – good for compatibility. Option d shows low agreeableness (likely to cause conflicts) – lowest score.
•	Q12 (No reply all day – attachment/trust): a = 4 (secure trust), b = 3 (minor frustration but okay), c = 1 (high anxiety attachment reaction), d = 3 (independent/avoidant – we’ll give a moderate score here; it’s not anxious, but extreme indifference could be an issue in some cases).
Rationale: Option c would signal an anxious attachment style (Attachment Style Quiz: What's Your Relationship Attachment Style?), which often needs special reassurance in relationships; thus for general compatibility we score it low (to potentially trigger a Yellow/Red flag to address in guidance). Option a indicates a secure style – ideal scenario, high score.
•	Q16 (Jealousy): a = 4 (trusting), b = 3 (normal mild jealousy), c = 1 (prone to jealousy, potential trust issues), d = 2 (dismissing jealousy, could mean either secure or too unconcerned).
Rationale: Very high jealousy (c) is generally a negative for relationship health, as it can lead to conflict and controlling behavior. Thus, low score on EQ.
•	Q22 (Same religion/caste importance): a = 1 (very rigid on same background), b = 2, c = 3, d = 4 (completely open).
Rationale: In the Values category, being extremely insistent on same background (a) means the user’s pool of acceptable partners is narrower – not “bad,” but compatibility will require someone of that exact background. We score it low to likely produce a caution (Yellow/Red) unless other factors are very flexible. An open attitude (d) scores highest as it indicates versatility in finding a match. (The guidance will carefully frame that neither is morally good/bad, just that certain answers necessitate finding a like-minded partner.)
•	Q24 (Divorce acceptable?): a = 1 (never divorce), b = 2, c = 3, d = 4 (okay with divorce if unhappy).
Rationale: Someone who says “never ever divorce” (a) might endure very unhappy situations or expect a partner to do the same – this traditional view can clash if the partner is more modern. That rigidity gets a low score as a compatibility warning. Someone open to divorce (d) is more modern; we score it higher for flexibility, though we’ll also note in guidance that they’d match well with similarly independent thinkers rather than someone very traditional.
•	Q34 (Partner’s virginity importance): a = 1 (must be virgin), b = 2, c = 3, d = 4 (irrelevant).
Rationale: This is straightforward – the more importance on virginity, the more that user needs a partner with identical values (since many in modern dating scene might not meet that criteria). So high importance yields a low compatibility-flexibility score (again, not a judgment, just a matching consideration). Option d (doesn’t care at all) indicates a very open-minded stance that can match with partners regardless of past, hence high score.
•	Q36 (Comfort discussing sex): a = 4 (very open), b = 3, c = 2, d = 1 (avoids topic).
Rationale: Open communication about intimacy typically leads to better mutual satisfaction (Dimensions of Couples' Sexual Communication, Relationship ...), so a is ideal. If someone cannot talk about it (d), they risk misunderstandings or unresolved issues, hence a low score pointing to an area for growth.
Each question will be scored in a similar fashion. The developer will implement a scoring key for all 40 questions mapping each option (a–d) to a numeric value. For transparency and maintainability, this can be stored in a configuration or data structure (e.g., a JSON or Python dictionary mapping question number and option to scores).
Category Scores Calculation: Once all questions are answered and scored:
•	Personality Score (0–100): We will compute this as the average of the 10 personality question scores, scaled to 100. However, we will also derive a Big Five trait profile from these responses. For instance, extraversion-related questions (Q1, Q6) give an extraversion score, agreeableness-related (Q4, Q9-opt c/d, Q14) give an agreeableness score, etc. These trait scores (likely on a 0–100 scale each) will be used for the radar chart. The “Personality” section score can be an aggregate indicating how overall conducive their personality is in relationships (taking into account positive traits vs. any challenging traits like high neuroticism). We might compute it as: (Extroversion + Agreeableness + Conscientiousness + Openness + (100 - Neuroticism)) / 5 to reward high in first four and low neuroticism. This yields a percentage.
•	Emotional Intelligence (EQ) Score (0–100): Average of scores from Q11–20 (each 1–4 scaled). This reflects their overall emotional maturity, communication, and attachment security in relationships. 100 would indicate very high EQ (secure, communicative, empathetic), whereas low values indicate many potential issues (like anxious/avoidant patterns or poor conflict resolution).
•	Values Score (0–100): Average of scores from Q21–30. A higher score here means the user has values or beliefs that are broadly compatible (e.g. more open-minded, moderate stances), whereas a lower score means the user has strong specific values that will require a partner with the same values (e.g. very traditional or very particular beliefs).
•	Physical/Moral Beliefs Score (0–100): Average of scores from Q31–40. High means the user is generally open and in sync with modern norms (or at least communicative/considerate about differences), low means the user has particular expectations about intimacy that could limit compatibility if not shared (e.g. requiring waiting till marriage or extremely low need for sex vs. very high need).
The system will compute each category score and round to an integer (0–100). These scores will feed into generating the compatibility color code and the personalized advice.
Compatibility Color Code Logic (Green/Yellow/Red): After obtaining the section scores, we assign an overall color as follows:
•	Green: The user’s answers indicate a generally compatibility-friendly profile. Typically, this means all category scores are moderately high (e.g. all above ~70%), or at least none of the categories have a critically low score. The user is likely flexible, emotionally mature, and values-aligned with a broad range of people. A green light means they should have relatively smooth time finding a compatible partner (though we will still tailor advice).
•	Yellow: This is a caution or mixed result. It would apply if one or two categories have middling or low scores that could pose challenges. For example, maybe the user has great personality and EQ scores but a low Values score (indicating very strong traditional views), or high scores except Physical Beliefs is low (very strict intimacy views). Yellow suggests that with the right partner (one who matches those specific areas) they can be happy, but they need to be cautious about whom they date. It’s an encouragement to be mindful and perhaps work on certain areas.
•	Red: The profile has significant compatibility hurdles. This might be assigned if multiple categories are quite low (<40–50%), or one category is extremely low in a way that tends to override others. For instance, if the user has very low EQ (lots of attachment insecurities and poor communication) and very rigid values, or some combination like that. Red doesn’t mean hopeless – it means the user’s criteria or behaviors will make it hard to find and keep a match unless those issues are addressed or they find a very niche match. The report will strongly encourage growth and understanding.
The algorithm to determine the color could be:
•	If any category score <= 40: Overall = Red (major compatibility risks identified).
•	Else if any category score <= 60: Overall = Yellow (some moderate risks or rigid points).
•	Else: Overall = Green (generally no serious red flags).
(We will fine-tune threshold values during testing with sample data, to ensure a balanced distribution. For example, thresholds might be adjusted to 50/70 or so based on how scores typically fall.)
Additionally, we will incorporate specific answer combinations that warrant a Red or Yellow regardless of numeric score. For instance: if the user selected the most extreme traditional options on many key questions (even if each individually scored, say, 1 or 2 but others are high), the numeric average might not fully capture that all their low answers were clustered in Values/Physical. But likely it will, as those category scores would be low. Another example: if a user shows an attachment mismatch in answers (like extremely anxious responses in several EQ questions) we might mark at least Yellow to highlight that issue even if others are fine. Our threshold rule above would catch it because multiple anxious answers yield low EQ score.
Output Normalization: All scores will be expressed as percentages (0–100) or as “out of 10” for simplicity (since 40 questions * 4 max = 160 points total, we can rescale). But percentage is straightforward and user-friendly. We’ll ensure each section’s questions contribute equally to that section’s score.
Big Five Trait Breakdown: Internally, we map certain questions to the Big Five traits:
•	Openness: Q9 (option a vs b), Q15 (maybe an aspect of open to other’s success? Not directly), Q22, Q28 (traditional vs open to differences), etc. Actually, cultural openness is different from Big Five openness (which is more creative vs practical). We explicitly targeted creativity in Q9a vs 9b. We might use Q9 and one of Q1 or Q3 (trying new plan vs routine) for Openness.
•	Conscientiousness: Q2, Q3, Q7 are direct.
•	Extraversion: Q1, Q6 are direct.
•	Agreeableness: Q4, Q14, Q9 (c vs d) all hint at agreeableness vs bluntness, plus Q18 conflict response.
•	Neuroticism (vs Emotional Stability): Q4 (c is neurotic reaction), Q11 (d is anxious), Q19 (c is neurotic stress response). Also jealousy Q16 (c anxious).
We will compute a score 0–100 for each trait based on relevant questions. This will be used purely for the radar chart visualization and for nuanced commentary (for example, “You scored high on Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, which suggests you are a dependable and caring partner – great traits in a relationship (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today) (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today). You scored lower on Emotional Stability (Neuroticism), indicating you may experience anxiety or moodiness that could affect relationships (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today), so managing stress is important.” etc.).
Report Generation & Content
Once scoring is done, the system generates a multi-part Compatibility Report. The report will be presented to the user after payment (details on payment flow in the next section). The report consists of:
•	A header with the Compatibility Color Code: e.g. “Overall Compatibility Profile: GREEN” (or Yellow/Red, with the word in the respective color). This immediately gives the user a quick visual summary. It will be accompanied by a one-liner explanation:
o	Green: “You have a well-rounded profile that should make finding a compatible partner easier. 👍”
o	Yellow: “You have a mix of flexible and firm traits – some areas to be mindful of in dating. 🤔”
o	Red: “You have some strong specific needs or challenges – finding the right partner will require careful alignment. 🚩” (We will phrase it positively, e.g. “With self-awareness, you can find love, but it’s important to acknowledge certain challenges.”)
•	Section-wise Breakdown: The report will then detail each of the four sections (Personality, EQ, Values, Physical/Moral) with:
o	The score (e.g. 78/100) possibly shown as a colored bar or meter. The color of each bar can indicate high (green zone), medium (yellow), low (red) relative to an internal benchmark.
o	A short description interpreting that score. For example:
	Personality: “You scored 78 in Personality. You are quite extroverted and open-minded, with high conscientiousness. This suggests you are outgoing and reliable – qualities that often attract oth (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today) (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today)42】. You also show moderate emotional stability with some sensitivity (you do take criticism somewhat personally). Overall, your personality should generally help in relationships, but you might need to ensure any partner can handle your occasional mood dips.”
	Emotional Intelligence: “EQ Score: 65. You have many positive habits – e.g., you cool off after arguments and then resolve them, which is healthy. You show empathy when your partner is upset, though at times you struggle to open up about your own feelings. There’s a hint of anxious attachment in some answers (worrying when not replied to), which means you value reassurance. Building more self-soothing techniques could help (e.g., remind yourself that a delay in response doesn’t mean rejection). On the whole, you’re fairly emotionally aware, but there’s room to grow towards a secure attachment style.”
	Values: “Values Score: 45. You have quite traditional values in certain areas – for instance, you strongly prefer a partner from the same background and you believe marriage is for life with no room for divorce. These convictions are part of who you are and can be positive (e.g., they show loyalty and commitm (Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) shows that liberals prioritize values ...)26】). However, they will significantly narrow your pool of potential matches to those who share the same traditional outlook. You’ll want to seek partners who have similar religious and cultural values and are equally commitment-minded. Be aware that if you date someone more liberal, conflicts could arise around these issues. Compromise might be difficult on these points, so alignment with your partner is key.”
	Physical/Moral Beliefs: “Physical & Intimacy Beliefs Score: 90. You’re very open and modern regarding intimacy – comfortable with premarital sex and discussing sexual matters freely. You put a lot of importance on sexual chemistry (which is healthy as it is a key factor in relationship satisfact ( What Matters in a Relationship—Age, Sexual Satisfaction, Relationship Length, and Interpersonal Closeness as Predictors of Relationship Satisfaction in Young Adults - PMC )99】) and you don’t tie sex exclusively to marriage or virginity. This openness means you would match well with someone who is similarly open-minded and values physical connection. However, be mindful if you date someone more conservative in this area; it might not work out unless one of you is willing to adjust expectations. The good news is you likely communicate needs well, which can lead to a fulfilling intimate life with the right person.”
Each section analysis will reference the theories (implicitly or explicitly) – for example, mentioning attachment style if EQ score indicates anxious or avoidant (we will use terms like “anxious tendencies” and explain th (Attachment Style Quiz: What's Your Relationship Attachment Style?)94】, or referencing moral values differences if relevant (maybe citing how common or uncommon their stance is, using info like 61% vs 63% from the survey to normalize their view). The citations and research insights we collected will inform these interpretations (we’ll include some in the actual text as shown with the references).
•	Big Five Radar Chart: We will include a radar/spider chart graphic that plots the user’s Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism (labeled as “Emotional Stability” for positive framing, perhaps)). This gives a visual snapshot of their personality. For example, a user might see a radar where Openness and Conscientiousness spikes high, Neuroticism (Emotional Stability) is moderate, etc. This complements the text. We’ll generate this radar chart dynamically (perhaps using a JavaScript chart library or a static image generated on server) based on trait scores. Each axis can be color-coded (maybe using the category colors: personality might use a distinct color or just one color for all since it’s one category). The chart helps users quickly see “ah, I’m very high on Agreeableness but low on Neuroticism” etc., reinforcing the narrative.
Next to the radar chart, we may list trait-specific insights: a short bullet for each trait with a tailored comment. E.g.:
o	Extroversion: 80 – You are quite outgoing and gregarious. You’ll thrive with a partner who enjoys socializing or at least supports your sociable nature. Don’t forget to occasionally give more introverted folks space, though!
o	Agreeableness: 90 – You’re very high in empathy and cooperation. You likely avoid unnecessary conflict and value harm (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today)77】. This is great, but beware of people-pleasing; make sure your own needs are voiced too.
o	Conscientiousness: 85 – You’re very responsible and organi (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today)39】. This makes you a dependable partner who follows through on promises. Partners will appreciate your reliability – just ensure flexibility for spontaneous fun too.
o	Emotional Stability: 60 – (Neuroticism moderate) You have some anxiety or mood swings under str (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today)27】. It’s normal, but learning coping strategies (exercise, mindfuln (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today)57】) can boost your relationship stability. Look for a partner who is patient and understanding during tough times.
o	Openness: 70 – You’re fairly open-minded and curious. You’ll enjoy sharing new experiences with a partner, though you also respect routine. A partner who is either similarly adventurous or can gently push you to explore new things would suit you well.
(Those comments incorporate advice and compliments based on trait scores, with subtle hints to what kind of partner fits each trait.)
•	Personalized Dating Guidance: This is the heart of the report where we synthesize everything. We will produce a narrative (in a friendly coach-like tone) that covers:
o	Ideal Partner Profile: Based on the user’s scores and answers, we describe the kind of person who might complement them well. This includes personality fit and values fit. For example: “You would likely do best with a partner who shares your core values (e.g., someone who is also career-focused and moderate in tradition, given your balance of modern outlook and some family orientation). Since you are high in Agreeableness and somewhat sensitive, a kind-hearted partner who communicates gently would make you happiest – harsh or overly critical personalities might hurt you. Your high extroversion means you’ll enjoy a partner who either is outgoing too, or who at least doesn’t mind you being the social butterfly while they cheer you on. Importantly, given your stance on premarital sex (you’re open to it), you should seek someone comfortable with that; a very conservative partner might leave you feeling frustrated or rejected in that aspect.” We basically outline the green flags to seek: people with certain traits or shared beliefs that align with the user.
o	People to Possibly Avoid: We will gently highlight what types of partners could be particularly challenging for them, essentially the opposite of above. Using the same example: “On the flip side, you may struggle with a partner who is extremely traditional or rigid where you are flexible – for instance, someone who insists on a virginal bride or has very strict gender roles would clash with your moderate views. Likewise, if you date someone very emotionally distant (low in empathy), they might not give you the level of affection and reassurance you enjoy. Be cautious with ultra-introverted partners too – they might not enjoy the high level of social activity you thrive on. Compatibility is about balance: differences can enrich, but extreme mismatches in these fundamental areas would require a lot of work.” This sets some red flags for them to consider when evaluating matches.
o	Dealbreakers & Non-negotiables: Based on any very low scored answers, we’ll list those as the user’s own likely dealbreakers. For example, if they answered they could never tolerate cheating, then cheating is a zero-tolerance for them (we reflect that: “Honesty is a non-negotiable for you – any infidelity would likely be a deal-breaker in your book, so you’ll need a partner who shares that commitment to exclusivity.”). If they said must be same religion, that’s a non-negotiable we reiterate: “You have made it clear that sharing the same faith and community is a must. That will be a guiding filter in your partner search – and that’s okay, just important to acknowledge upfront.” Identifying these helps the user stick to their values and communicate them. Conversely, if their profile shows flexibility, we note they don’t have many hard dealbreakers beyond basic respect, etc.
	We will also point out potential contradictions if present: e.g., in the case from the Hindustan Times sur (63% want to marry virgins, but majority approve of premarital sex | Latest News India - Hindustan Times)54】, if a user answered that premarital sex is okay (Q33 c or d) but also that they want their partner to be a virgin (Q34 a or b), we’d highlight this discrepancy: “We noticed a bit of a paradox in your answers: you seem personally open to premarital sex in principle, yet you also prefer a partner who has never had prior sexual experience. This suggests an internal conflict between your modern views and traditional expectations. It might be worth reflecting on why you feel this way – is it due to societal/family pressure or an ideal of ‘saving for marriage’? Recognizing this can help you resolve any double standards and approach relationships more consistently and fairly.” This kind of gentle calling-out can encourage personal growth and honesty with oneself.
o	Areas for Compromise: We encourage the user to think about where they might need to bend a little in relationships. For example: “Since you value career a lot and might delay marriage for it, you may need to compromise by finding a partner who respects your ambition – and you might need to reassure them of commitment in other ways until you’re ready for the next step. If having children or settling is not immediate for you, be upfront so you can find someone on the same timeline or willing to wait.” Or, “You’re very independent (avoidant leaning), but if you fall for someone who needs more affection, you’ll both need to meet halfway – you giving a bit more closeness, and them giving you personal space when you need it.” Essentially, prepare them for relationship adjustments.
o	Suggestions for Personal Growth: In a motivational tone, we add tips tailored to their low spots. We frame it positively: “No one is perfect, but relationships often push us to grow. For instance, you acknowledged trouble expressing feelings (you often bottle things up). Working on this could greatly improve your future relationship. Consider practicing sharing small concerns or thoughts with people you trust, so it feels more natural to open up. You might be surprised – a good partner will want to hear what you feel. Building this skill will strengthen your emotional bond.” Another example: “Your profile shows a tendency to get anxious in love. It might help to build your self-confidence outside of the relationship – pursue hobbies, maintain friendships – so you feel more secure. When you catch yourself worrying, remind yourself of your partner’s positive actions. Some users in your range have benefited from journaling or therapy to work on anxiety, turning attachment insecurities into a more secure style.” This encourages growth without stigma. We can cite known advice like mindfulness for anxi (Love and the Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today)57】 or Gottman’s findings if relevant in text (but likely keep the tone conversational).
Throughout the guidance, the tone will remain positive and empowering. Even for a Red profile, after discussing challenges, we’ll include motivating lines like: “Remember, these insights are meant to help you grow, not to label you. Self-awareness is a huge first step – now you know what you want and where you can improve. With that knowledge, you absolutely can find a fulfilling relationship. Many others have reconciled similar differences by communicating and understanding each other.” We might include a quote or two for inspiration (maybe a famous saying about relationships or growth, if appropriate and not too cheesy).
We will also integrate the idea that similarities matter: e.g. “Compatibility isn’t about being identical, but about how you handle differences. Studies show most happy couples share a lot of core val (Opposites may not actually attract when it comes to love as old theory debunked | Nestia)74】 – you can now identify which values you need to share, and which differences you can embrace.”
•	Motivational Close: End the report with an upbeat note. Possibly something like: “Dating is a journey of discovering others and yourself. Use this profile as a guide, not a rulebook. Keep an open mind and heart. The right person will appreciate you for who you are – and thanks to your self-reflection here, you’re ready to meet them with clarity and confidence. 💖” Encourage them to revisit the advice, and to continuously grow.
•	Shareable Badge/Image: Finally, we present a graphic or badge that the user can share on social media. This will be generated based on their results. We might have a few templates such as:
o	A small image with a colored border or background corresponding to Green/Yellow/Red.
o	It might say something fun like: “Compatibility: GREEN – The Balanced Soul”, or “I got a Yellow Light in the Dating Profile quiz – cautious romantic 🚦”, or “Red doesn’t scare me – I know what I want! ❤️” – something witty but not embarrassing. We have to be careful: users might not want to share if labeled Red due to stigma. Perhaps the shareable focuses on positive traits instead. Alternatively, the badge could highlight a positive aspect: e.g., “Friendly Social Butterfly – looking for my match!” if they had high Extroversion and agreeableness. But customizing that might be complex for MVP.
For simplicity, perhaps the share image shows the radar chart (so they share their trait shape) with a caption like “Meet [perhaps a nickname] – extroverted, caring, traditional – looking for love!” This way it’s descriptive. We can generate a nickname or tagline from their dominant traits, e.g.:
o	If extroverted and open: “Adventurous Connector”
o	If high traditional and conscientious: “Loyal Traditionalist”
o	etc., or even use MBTI terminology if we derive it (like ENFP etc.) because people love sharing that. But MBTI wasn’t directly assessed fully (we could guess from answers though). Perhaps not in MVP due to complexity.
For now, maybe simpler: shareable card with their first name (if collected) or just “My Dating Profile Results” and a summary line: e.g., “High EQ, Open-minded, Values family, Waiting till marriage: ✅” (some key points as tick marks or short words) – but that may be too personal for sharing. Perhaps better to keep it light:
o	Example: A Green profile share text: “My dating personality is balanced and ready for love! 💚 What about you? (Take the quiz!)”
o	Yellow: “I got a Yellow in the dating compatibility quiz – try it to see what color you get!”
o	Red: “This quiz gave me amazing insights about myself. Take it and see yours – it’s eye-opening!” (We can downplay the Red in the share message if needed.)
We will likely let the user choose to share just the color or some fun title rather than all details (for privacy). The share feature is mainly for virality to attract more users to take the quiz, so it should tease rather than reveal sensitive info. Perhaps we give them an option to customize the message.
Technically, the shareable image can be generated using an HTML canvas or a server-side image generation with the relevant data. The image will include the app branding and maybe a link/QR code to the quiz to encourage others.
•	PDF Download: A button/link will allow the user to download the full report as a PDF. The PDF will contain all the above content in a nicely formatted manner (with the charts, breakdowns, and guidance). Details on generation in next section.
All the text for the report (section explanations, advice snippets for various score ranges, etc.) will be prepared and stored, so the system can assemble the personalized report by inserting the user’s scores and relevant segments. For maintainability, we can use a template system or logic that picks from pre-written text blocks based on score thresholds. For example, for the Values section, we could have 3 blocks of text for high, medium, low scores and choose accordingly, with slight tweaks if certain specific answers (like religion importance) were extreme. The plan is to fully automate the interpretation by mapping certain answer patterns to specific advice.
During implementation, we’ll test with sample profiles (e.g., someone very liberal vs very traditional, someone anxious vs avoidant, etc.) to ensure the report feels coherent and accurate for each. Since we’ve documented clear logic for each question’s implication, the developer can codify those rules.
Preview & Payment Flow (Razorpay Integration)
To monetize the MVP, we will show users a preview of their results after they complete the questionnaire, and then require a payment via Razorpay to unlock the full detailed report and downloadable PDF. Here’s how the flow will work:
1.	User completes all 40 questions and clicks on the “See Results” (or similar) button.
2.	The system immediately calculates the scores and generates at least the Compatibility Color Code and the section scores summary. These are used to create a preview screen. The preview will not reveal the full analysis or advice, but it will tease the content to entice the user to pay for more.
o	For example, the preview might show:
“Overall Compatibility: YELLOW” (with a brief description like “You have a cautious compatibility profile. There are some areas you should pay attention to in dating.”).
It might also show the 4 section scores as colored bars or percentages without the detailed explanations. E.g.:
	Personality: 72/100
	Emotional Intelligence: 60/100
	Values Alignment: 45/100
	Physical Beliefs: 80/100
These numbers by themselves are informative but not deeply useful until explained – which creates curiosity.
o	Optionally, we could show one highlight insight. For instance, a single bullet like “Key Insight: You value tradition a lot more than your peers – finding a like-minded partner will be important for you.” or “Key Insight: Your emotional style is mostly secure with a touch of anxiety – awareness of this can help in your next relationship.” Just one line that comes from whichever category stands out the most (like the lowest score or highest score trait). But we must be careful not to give away too much of the “meat” of the analysis for free. The goal is to demonstrate credibility (so the user trusts that the full report has depth) and to hook their interest.
o	We might also show the silhouette of the radar chart with blurred labels, saying “Your Personality Radar (Unlocked in full report)” to make them curious about that visual. Or perhaps show the radar but with trait names hidden or values blurred. Similarly, maybe a snippet of the guidance like “Ideal Partner: … [Unlocked]” truncated.
3.	The preview screen then clearly prompts the user to purchase to view the full report. For example: “Unlock your Full Compatibility Report – 5+ pages of personalized insights, advice, and charts – for just ₹X.” (Razorpay will handle INR, since the user is in India). We’ll have a “Unlock Full Report” button on this screen.
4.	On clicking “Unlock Full Report”, the front-end will initiate the Razorpay payment flow. We will integrate Razorpay’s Checkout. Typically, we’ll need to create an order via Razorpay API (if we have a backend) or use the Razorpay Checkout widget with key ID and an orderID. For MVP, we might use Razorpay’s test mode first, then live mode.
o	The user enters their payment details (card/UPI/Netbanking – Razorpay supports many local methods). Razorpay processes the payment securely.
5.	Payment Success Callback: Once payment is successful, Razorpay’s widget will trigger a callback in our app. We will verify the payment (ideally by calling our backend to verify signature if using that flow, for security).
6.	After verification, we then reveal the full report. This could be done by dynamically loading the content on the same page or redirecting to a dedicated “report” page. Since we already computed the results, we can now display all the sections with detailed text, charts, etc. The PDF download and share buttons become active at this point.
7.	Payment Failure/Abort: If the payment is cancelled or fails, the user remains on the preview. We’ll handle this gracefully – e.g., show a message “Payment was not completed. You can retry to unlock your report.” The data (scores) should be kept for some time so they don’t lose their results if they want to try paying again. We might allow them to retry payment easily.
8.	Pricing considerations: For MVP, likely a one-time payment for the report. We should also consider allowing the user to come back to their report later without paying again (so we need to store their results or provide a login/email to retrieve). If not implementing login, maybe at least offer to email the report PDF upon purchase as a fail-safe. We can integrate sending the PDF to their email via an email API after purchase, or prompt them to enter email for receipt. But MVP can skip email if needed, though it’s user-friendly. We’ll mention storing or emailing in user journey.
Razorpay Integration details for developer:
•	Use Razorpay Checkout JS library in frontend. Provide it with the amount, currency, order_id (from backend if we have one, to securely generate payment).
•	Alternatively, simpler: use Razorpay’s Dashboard to create a payment link and redirect, but that’s less smooth than embedded checkout. Better to integrate JS.
•	We will include the user’s identifier or a result token so that after payment, we know which result to show. Possibly, compute results and store them in a temporary database keyed by a session or a temp ID. When payment succeeds, attach that ID in Razorpay order metadata, so when callback comes, we load the correct results. If doing fully on frontend without backend persistence, we might just keep the results in memory and display upon success (assuming user doesn’t close page). That’s fine for MVP.
•	Razorpay provides a success callback with a payment_id and a signature that should be verified. For MVP, if no backend, might skip strict verification (which has a slight risk). Ideally, implement a small backend function to verify the signature with our Razorpay secret to ensure the payment is legit. But if trusting Razorpay’s event, likely fine.
•	After unlocking, mark the user as paid. If they refresh page, if we aren’t storing, they’d lose it. Possibly prompt them to download PDF to keep it, or if we have user’s email, we could allow later retrieval.
For now, our scope is to outline this logic for the developer; they will implement accordingly on Replit (which can run a Python/Node backend if needed, or a purely client approach).
PDF Generation Strategy
To enable the user to download their full report, we need to generate a PDF of the results. There are a few approaches:
1.	Client-side PDF generation: Since the report is essentially an HTML view with charts and text, we can use a library like jsPDF (with html2canvas) in the browser. After the report is unlocked and rendered in the DOM, a “Download PDF” button can trigger a script that takes the report div, converts it to a canvas image, and then to a PDF. We’ll need to ensure the layout is printable (single column, not too interactive). This method keeps everything on the client and is simpler to deploy on Replit (no additional server configuration). We must test that the charts (which might be SVG/canvas via chart library) are captured properly by html2canvas. If not, we might have to regenerate charts in the canvas or use their image data (most chart libraries can export an image of the chart).
o	Pros: No server load, immediate.
o	Cons: Might have quality limitations (especially with a radar chart image). We can mitigate by setting a high DPI on canvas.
2.	Server-side PDF generation: We could use a library like ReportLab (Python) or Puppeteer (Node) to render the report HTML to PDF on the server. For example, an endpoint that accepts the user’s result data and uses headless Chrome to produce a PDF of a hidden page. Or use a service. On Replit, installing Puppeteer might be heavy. Python’s ReportLab would require manually laying out the text and charts (complex). There’s also WeasyPrint or wkhtmltopdf if those can be installed on Replit.
Given MVP scope, client-side is likely easier. We will propose the client-side approach.
Chosen Strategy: Generate PDF in Browser using html2canvas + jsPDF.
•	After rendering the report, the user clicks “Download PDF”.
•	We might briefly show a loading spinner “Preparing your PDF...”.
•	The script clones or uses the report container, perhaps adjusts styles for print (for example, ensure all sections expanded).
•	Use html2canvas to snapshot each section if the report is long. Possibly snapshot in pieces (like one for the header and intro, one for each major section) to maintain good resolution, then add each as a page in jsPDF. jsPDF can combine images into multi-page PDF.
•	We ensure to add page titles or page numbers. Maybe a nice cover page with the quiz title and their name/color. But that might be extra – at least include everything in one PDF.
•	This way, the PDF will look similar to what they see on screen. The radar chart and any bar charts will be included as images.
•	Test on various device sizes to ensure it captures well (if user on mobile, etc., we might want a specific width for PDF generation).
Additionally, we should consider PDF styling: Use high-contrast colors (white background, etc.) for printing. The charts should ideally be color but distinguishable if printed in grayscale (use patterns or labels on axes).
We will instruct the developer on any specifics, but likely using libraries will suffice. Many tutorials exist for “html2canvas jspdf screenshot of div to pdf.”
As a backup, we can also include a simple “Print” button that calls window.print() as an alternative, so they can use browser’s PDF printer. But that may not capture canvas charts without special CSS (there’s a media print consideration). Given time, the jsPDF route is clearer.
We should also mention an option to email the PDF to the user after generation. If we collect email (maybe as part of payment or an optional field), we could send it via an email API (like using Replit backend to send email with SendGrid or similar). For MVP, maybe not required, but it’s a nice touch to ensure they don’t lose it.
We’ll include that as a suggestion: e.g. “After generating PDF, the system can offer to email it for convenience.”
Post-Launch User Journey & Automation
Here we outline how the entire user experience will flow from start to finish, and how the system automates each step without manual intervention:
1.	User Acquisition & Entry: A user lands on the web app (perhaps via a shared link or an ad). The homepage or landing screen likely pitches the quiz: e.g., “Find out your Dating Personality and Compatibility – Take the Quiz!”. The user clicks “Start Quiz”. (Marketing and acquisition will be handled outside this spec, but we assume users come in ready to take the quiz.)
2.	Quiz Experience: The user is presented with the questions one by one (or in sections). The UI should be mobile-friendly (since many will use phones). We suggest using a progressive disclosure: show one question at a time with 4 option buttons, and a progress bar (e.g., “12/40 completed”). This keeps it from feeling overwhelming. Possibly group by sections but it’s okay sequentially. The tone of the UI can be playful (maybe little emojis or icons per question theme to keep interest). The user selects answers; their choices are stored in state. They can navigate back to previous questions if needed to change answers (optional, but good UX to allow review).
o	No manual intervention needed; the questions and options are pre-coded. If using a form library or custom logic, it should validate that all questions answered before proceeding.
3.	Completion & Result Computation: Upon the final question submission, the app instantly calculates the results using the logic described. This is an automatic function summing up scores and determining categories and color.
o	All the data mapping (score values, thresholds) is coded in. No human input. Possibly store the raw answers for record (in localStorage or a database if we want analytics, but not required for functionality).
4.	Result Preview: The app shows the preview with partial results. This is fully automated – it takes the computed results and populates the preview template. No manual step. The user at this point is prompted to pay.
5.	Payment: The Razorpay integration is automated. When user clicks unlock, the system either already created a payment order (via API call) or does so on the fly, then opens the Razorpay checkout. The user completes payment (with OTP, etc. if needed). This is all handled by Razorpay’s secure interface. Once done, their script calls our JS callback.
o	If we have a backend, the Razorpay webhook can also confirm payment, but for immediate user feedback, the front-end callback will suffice to unlock content right away.
6.	Full Report Display: Immediately after payment confirmation, the app reveals the full report. This could be the same page expanding or a new page. Regardless, all content generation is automated. The narrative text segments (for personality, EQ, etc.) are generated by the app using the rules. Possibly we use a templating approach:
o	For each category, pick one of several pre-written paragraphs based on high/med/low score.
o	Insert specific phrases where needed (like if they had an anxious attachment, insert a sentence about that, if certain answer was extreme, include that note). This might use conditional logic in code. All that logic follows what we outlined, and the text for each case is written out (like we did in examples). The developer will use this spec’s text as a basis to implement these conditions.
o	The Big Five trait comments similarly generated from their trait scores.
The visual elements are created: the radar chart can be drawn using a JS library (like Chart.js or d3.js). We feed in the trait scores computed; the library renders the chart on a canvas. The bar graphs for section scores can also use a chart library or simple CSS bars. Colors chosen to reflect levels (green gradient for high, yellow for mid, red for low, etc.). All this appears on the page now.
No human input needed; the app does it all.
7.	User Interaction with Report: The user can now scroll and read their entire report. They can click “Download PDF” – this triggers the automated PDF generation as described. They can click “Share” – which triggers either an image download of the badge or an API call to generate a share image and then prompts share (if on mobile, maybe use Web Share API, or simply show them the image to post and a link).
o	The share action is user-initiated but the content is pre-defined template plus their summary. No manual step. Possibly integrate with social media APIs or just let them manually share.
8.	Data Storage (optional but recommended): We can save the user’s results in a database if they are logged in or if we ask for an email. For an MVP, we might not have a login system. Alternatively, after payment we could show a field “enter your email to receive a copy of your report”. If provided, we email the PDF. We can also store their data keyed by a UUID and email, so if they revisit, we could allow “retrieve my report” by email (by sending a magic link or so).
Regardless, the system can store anonymized data for analytics: e.g., distribution of answers, average scores, how many got Green/Yellow/Red. This is useful for improving the quiz and marketing (“Only 10% got Green – find out why!” etc.). Implementation: simply log results to a database or Google Sheet via API, etc., with no personal identifiers unless email given.
9.	Post-Launch Operation: The entire process from start to finish is automated. The user self-serves everything. The payment is processed automatically. The content is delivered automatically. If multiple users are using simultaneously, all calculations are local or on our server in isolated sessions – scalable for typical use (Replit can handle moderate traffic; might need upgrading for heavy use).
We should ensure robustness: e.g., if a user refreshes after payment, do they lose access? Ideally, after payment, we mark something (maybe in localStorage or database) so that they can re-open the report without paying again. Perhaps a unique report ID. If we email them the PDF, that covers it. But better if the app itself can detect a paid session (maybe via Razorpay payment_id attached to user session). We’ll instruct the dev to consider that, maybe by writing a cookie or database entry that that user (if identified by something) paid. If no login, maybe rely on Razorpay’s receipt which could be email/phone if we collect those at payment.
As an MVP, perhaps simpler: once they have the PDF, they have it. If they refresh and lose it, they might have to contact support or retake. We can minimize refresh by clearly guiding them to download or save. But storing email is a good idea to avoid that scenario.
All these steps can run without any manual oversight. Payment receipts and errors can be monitored via Razorpay dashboard.
10.	Future Automation Potential: If user consents to be contacted, we could automate follow-ups: e.g., a week later, email “Hope you found your report useful! Here are some tips to make the most of it…” or promote a related service. Since it’s MVP, focus is on delivering the product, but good to note.
Everything, from quiz answering to report generation, is coded to run on its own. The developer on Replit will ensure the environment can handle generating charts (perhaps include Chart.js library in HTML, etc.), and Razorpay integration (include their script).
Finally, we will provide a nicely formatted document (this text) to the developer. The developer can then directly use the questions text, options, and the logic provided to implement the system. All content is centralized here so they won’t need to scramble for copy or rules – it’s all clearly laid out and sourced from credible theory and data (as evidenced by citations like 【20】, 【18】, etc. which we included for reference).
End of Specification.
