How It Works
Dating doesn’t come with a user manual, but WhoToDate might be the next best thing! We’ve made the process simple and user-friendly. In fact, you can break it down into three easy steps. And remember: unlike a dating app, we’re not setting you up on dates or showing you profiles of strangers. We’re setting you up with self-insights that you can then take into the real world. No endless swiping (which often doesn’t even lead to a date, as two-thirds of online daters in India never meet their matches in person​

), no awkward small talk with randoms. Just you, exploring you. Here’s how to get started:
Step 1: Take the Quiz
This is the fun part! Simply hit the “Start Quiz” button and you’re off. The quiz has 40 questions covering various scenarios and preferences. It’s mostly multiple-choice and very intuitive. You don’t need to study or prep at all – just be honest with your answers for the best results. It’s not a test where you can fail, so relax and enjoy it. Most people finish in about 5 to 7 minutes. Some questions might make you chuckle or think “hmm, I never considered that about myself.” For example, we may ask how you’d react if you had to unexpectedly cancel a date, or whether you value truth over tact in a sensitive situation. These aren’t your typical “What’s your favorite color?” questions – they’re designed to reveal aspects of your personality and feelings in a low-key way. If you’re unsure about a question, just go with the option that feels most you. Don’t overthink it! There’s no timer, and you can’t “get it wrong.” Also, everything is confidential – your answers aren’t shared with anyone (not even with that crush you might have in mind 😉). So feel free to drop your guard and answer truthfully. Pro tip: If you’re doing this with friends for fun, that’s cool, but try to focus on your genuine responses rather than what sounds good. The more authentic you are, the more accurate your report will be. After the last question, hit submit… (drumroll) and within seconds, you’ll move to Step 2. 🎉
Step 2: Get Your Personalized Compatibility Report
Now comes the big reveal. Once you finish the quiz, instantly you’ll see your results page – this is your Compatibility Profile. Let’s break down what you’ll see here, because it’s packed with goodies:
Your Compatibility Badge: Front and center, you’ll notice a big colored badge – Green, Yellow, or Red – as we described earlier. This gives you a quick snapshot of your overall compatibility outlook. Don’t stop at the color, though, because the details are even more interesting.
Profile Overview: We give you a friendly summary of who you are as a dater. This might come with a fun title like “The Confident Connector” or “The Thoughtful Idealist” that encapsulates your style. In a sentence or two, we highlight your key strengths. For example: “You are empathetic and open-minded, with a dash of anxiety about getting hurt. You crave deep connection and you’re willing to put in the effort to make a relationship work.” This is like the TL;DR of your profile. Many users say just these couple lines make them feel “seen.”
Section-by-Section Breakdown: Here’s where we dive into the five areas (personality, etc.). We present it in a clean, readable format, often with subheadings or bullet points for each area:
Big Five Traits: You’ll see your scores or levels for each of the Big Five (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism). We might use a simple bar or descriptor (e.g., High, Medium, Low) for each. And we translate that into how it plays out in dating. Are you very high in Openness? Then we’ll note you love new experiences and might get along well with someone who’s adventurous too. Low in Extraversion? We’ll reassure that it’s fine – it just means you recharge alone, and we’ll suggest communicating that need to partners so they don’t take it personally. High Neuroticism? We’ll gently point out that you may feel emotions intensely, and provide a coping tip such as practicing mindfulness or ensuring you date someone patient and understanding. It’s like a mini personality reading focused on relationships.
MBTI Type: We’ll state your Myers-Briggs type (e.g., INFJ or ESTP etc.) and give a brief description of how people like you tend to behave in relationships. If you’re an INTJ, for example, we might say you’re strategic and loyal but sometimes struggle to express feelings openly – so a tip might be to consciously share what’s in your heart more often. If you’re an ESFP, we’ll celebrate your enthusiasm and warmth, and perhaps caution that your spontaneous nature is awesome but you might need to occasionally think long-term too. We try to make this part fun and affirming – MBTI types often feel like an identity badge people love to share.
Attachment Style: This is crucial. We’ll clearly label you as Secure, Anxious, Avoidant, or maybe a mix if it seems that way. Then we explain what that means in plain English. Secure: You’re comfortable with closeness and independence, which is great. Anxious: You love deeply but worry about being loved back – we’ll normalize this and remind you it’s something that can be managed; maybe suggest that you seek partners who are reassuring and consistent. Avoidant: You value independence a lot and might need extra time to open up – we’ll advise that you might match well with someone who respects your space but also gently pulls you out of your shell emotionally. If it’s a mix (say, “Anxious-Avoidant”), we’ll address both sides. This section often gives people a big “aha!” moment, connecting dots from their past relationships. We’ll also include a tip or two here: e.g., if Anxious, a tip might be “When you feel the urge to seek validation, try giving yourself a positive affirmation first; remember, you are worthy of love even if your partner is busy at the moment.” If Secure, “Keep up the good communication habits – they are gold! Consider mentoring friends who struggle in love (kidding, but you could!).”
Emotional Intelligence (EQ): Here we might not give a single label, but rather observations. We could mention aspects like communication skills, empathy, conflict resolution. For instance, “Empathy: High – you easily put yourself in others’ shoes, which helps you connect deeply. Conflict Style: Avoidant – you tend to steer clear of confrontation, which keeps things peaceful but could also lead to unresolved issues. Consider addressing concerns more directly when needed.” We might also point out if you’re particularly good at understanding others’ emotions or if you sometimes misread cues. If there’s a notable finding (like you scored very high in recognizing others’ feelings but low in expressing your own), we’ll highlight that. A tip here could be “Next time you feel upset, try naming the emotion (‘I feel hurt/ignored/etc.’) and let your partner know. It prevents bottling things up.” Basically, we translate your emotional strengths and weaknesses into practical advice for relationships.
Values & Compatibility Factors: We discuss your core values (from the Moral Foundations part). This might look like: “Top Values: Fairness and Care – you have a strong sense of justice and compassion. Low emphasis on Tradition – you aren’t big on doing things ‘because they’ve always been done that way’. In a partner, you’ll thrive with someone who shares your progressive mindset and empathy. Be aware that someone who heavily prioritizes, say, Authority (tradition/respect) might feel you’re too unconventional, and vice versa. Middle ground can be found with communication.” In this part, we might also mention things like religious outlook if gleanable, attitude towards things like monogamy or gender roles if any question addressed that indirectly, etc. It’s all about giving you a heads-up on where you and another person might see eye-to-eye or disagree fundamentally. This often ties back into the Indian cultural aspect, as values can be influenced by culture. If, for example, you appear to value Purity/tradition highly, we’ll interpret that as you perhaps preferring a more traditional relationship path (maybe no physical intimacy before commitment, or wanting a formally recognized relationship) – we’ll present that positively and suggest finding a partner who respects those values. If you’re on the other end (more liberal values), we encourage you to be upfront about that in the appropriate time while dating, to ensure compatibility.
Overall Compatibility Assessment: After the deep dive, we’ll circle back to what your Green/Yellow/Red badge means with all this context. This is a short wrap-up where we say something like, “In summary, you’re showing a lot of strengths (like being open-minded and secure) that bode well for love – hence the Green light! Just keep an eye on that perfectionist streak (high Conscientiousness) so it doesn’t lead to overcritical expectations. Your ideal partner is someone who shares your love for creativity and matches your communication style.” OR “Overall, you have a mix of traits (that’s why you got Yellow). You bring kindness and enthusiasm to the table, but you might clash with someone who doesn’t appreciate your frank honesty (since you’re very high on the Truth/Justice scale). With a bit of patience and by seeking a person whose values align (maybe someone who also values honesty and growth), you’ll do great.” For a Red, it would be reassuring: “Your profile shows quite a few potential conflict areas, which is why we gave a Red – but knowledge is power! Use this insight to actively work on what you can (e.g., emotional expression) and to find a partner who can meet you halfway on differences. We strongly suggest focusing on the tips above and even considering a chat with a counselor to turn these challenges into opportunities. A fulfilling love life is absolutely within reach with some effort.”
Next Steps & Resources: At the end of the report, we’ll have a little section for what you can do next. This includes a Call-to-Action to maybe retake later or share: “Reflect on these findings – maybe even journal about how you’ve seen these patterns in your life. If you have someone special in mind, encourage them to take the quiz too and compare notes! (It could be a great conversation starter.)” We also remind that “people grow and change – you can revisit this quiz in the future to see how far you’ve come.” Here we also mention the counselor option as discussed: “Want to discuss your results with an expert or need help in a specific area? Check out our recommended counselors who get this stuff (see below).” and perhaps a link to that. And if we have any articles or content (like blog posts on dating tips, etc.), we might link a couple relevant ones: e.g., “Read our article on 5 Ways to Increase Your Emotional Intelligence in Relationships if your EQ section was low.” or “Not sure how to talk about your attachment style with a partner? Here are some pointers.” This way, you leave the report not just with information, but with a plan or at least an inspiration to act on it.
Whew! That’s a lot of detail, because we believe in giving you a comprehensive picture. Most users are delighted (and sometimes surprised) by how much they learn about themselves. Some even say, “This felt like a mini therapy session – in a good way!” The report is designed for you to come back to as well. You might read it once and then again after a first date or two with someone, to remind yourself of what to look for. It’s emailed to you (if you provide an email) or you can save the link, and yes – you can download a PDF version to keep.
Step 3: Apply Your Results in Real Life (and Optional Expert Help)
Knowledge in hand, now it’s time to use it! WhoToDate doesn’t end at the quiz – it’s meant to guide your real-world dating and relationship decisions. Here’s how you can make the most of it: Use it as Your Dating Compass: Think of your compatibility report as a compass pointing you toward healthier relationships. Before, you might have been dating blindly – now you have a sense of direction. For instance, if your report highlighted that you value Honesty and Communication, prioritize those when you’re meeting new people. Maybe on your next date, instead of wondering “Do they like me?”, you’ll be thinking “Do our values and personalities align?” – a much more useful question! If your profile says you’re the type who needs some time to open up (maybe you’re an introvert or avoidant), don’t force yourself into rapid-fire dating or high-pressure situations; maybe suggest a low-key coffee date for a first meet, which suits you better. Essentially, let your new self-knowledge inform the way you date. You might avoid past pitfalls – like if you always went for the life-of-the-party types but now realize you actually clash with them, you can seek a different vibe in partners. Or if you learned you tend to rush into emotional intimacy (looking at you, anxious attachers!), you can remind yourself to take it a bit slower, communicate feelings gradually, and choose partners who are patient and consistent. Share and Discuss (if you want): A really cool way to use your results is to share them. You can do this in a few ways:
With a potential or current partner: If you’re dating someone, show them your results and invite them to take the quiz too. It’s a fun activity and opens up a conversation about your personalities and expectations. You might discover, for example, that your partner is an ESTJ (very organized and practical) while you’re an INFP (very idealistic and go-with-the-flow). That could spark a great talk on how you two can balance each other – maybe they help you stay grounded, and you help them dream big. Or, if both of you are secure attachment, celebrate that! If one is anxious and the other secure, it’s a chance for the secure partner to understand and reassure the anxious one more. Couples who discuss these things tend to build stronger empathy. It’s almost like taking a peek at the “guidebook” for loving that person.
On your dating profile: Some people choose to highlight parts of their WhoToDate results on their actual dating app profiles (if you’re using those in parallel). For example, you might mention “High EQ” or “Secure attachment”, or even just say “Took a compatibility quiz – turns out I’m a Green light dater! 😄 Ask me more about it.” This can intrigue matches in a good way. It shows you’re thoughtful about relationships. (Who knows, maybe they’ll ask for the link – sharing is caring!). If MBTI is popular in your circles, definitely mention your type – a lot of people love that info. Just by doing this, you attract those who find self-awareness attractive (which tend to be the better-quality matches, to be honest).
With friends: It’s not all about finding a partner; it’s also about community and support. Share your results with close friends or siblings. It can help them understand you better and maybe hold you accountable (“Hey, you said your report suggests not to jump in too fast – remember that when you’re tempted to say I love you on the second date!”). Also, encourage them to take it. You can compare results for fun, and even give each other dating advice based on them. It’s like having a little support group where everyone’s bringing their “profile” to the table.
Consider a Counselor or Coach: As we outlined in the Science section, if you feel you want more personalized help, you can reach out to one of our recommended counselors. This might be especially useful if you got a Red badge or if you have high anxiety about dating that the report identified. There’s no shame in seeking help – in fact, it’s a smart move and many people are doing it. A counselor can help you work through any internal blocks (maybe past heartbreak, fear of rejection, etc.) with the context of your WhoToDate results as a starting point. This can accelerate your personal growth and get you ready for a healthy relationship faster. Even one or two sessions can offer new perspectives. Retake or Revisit Down the Line: People change – and that’s beautiful. The person you are today might not be the person you are a year from now, especially if you actively work on yourself. Maybe you’ll go from a Yellow to a Green as you build new skills or find more clarity. We encourage you to come back and retake the quiz after some time or after significant life changes. Or simply re-read your report periodically to remind yourself of what to focus on. It’s like a living document for your personal development in the dating arena. Remember, It’s a Guide, Not Gospel: We believe strongly in our science, but human beings are wonderfully complex. No report can capture every nuance of you, and life has its surprises. So use our insights as guiding lights, not strict rules. For example, if your profile says you and a very traditional person might clash, it doesn’t mean you absolutely can’t date someone traditional – it means you’d have to communicate and compromise more. If your badge is Red, it doesn’t mean “don’t date now” – it means date thoughtfully and maybe work on yourself in parallel. Serendipity and chemistry are things we can’t predict, but when they happen, you’ll be better prepared to handle them with what you’ve learned about yourself. Finally, embrace the journey. Dating should not be a dreaded chore; it should be a journey of finding not just the right partner, but also discovering yourself. With WhoToDate, you’ve armed yourself with self-awareness that many people unfortunately lack. That alone gives you a head start! You’ll be able to spot red flags and green flags in others more easily, communicate your needs clearly, and not lose yourself trying to impress someone (we’ve got data on that – remember, a significant number of young Indians pretend to like things just to impress dates​

, and it’s exhausting). Now you can date authentically. That confidence and clarity you exude after understanding your profile? Trust us, it’s attractive. People will notice the self-assuredness.
